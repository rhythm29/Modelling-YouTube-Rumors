Video: id=CxrAso7rZ5stitle=Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Investigation Wide Open! NEW DEVELOPMENTSdescription=U.S. intelligence officials are leaning toward the theory that "those in the cockpit" -- the pilots of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 -- were responsible for the mysterious disappearance of the commercial jetliner, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the latest thinking told CNN on Saturday.
The revelation followed news that Malaysian authorities searched the home of the lead pilot, a move that came the same day that Prime Minister Najib Razak told reporters the plane veered off course due to apparent deliberate action taken by somebody on board.
The Malaysian government had been looking for a reason to search the home of the pilot and the co-pilot for several days. But it was only in the last 24 to 36 hours, when radar and satellite data came to light, that authorities believed they had sufficient reason to go through the residences, according to the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The Malaysians don't do this lightly," the official said. It's not clear whether the Malaysian government believes one or both the men could be responsible for what happened when the Boeing 777-200 ER disappeared March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
What we know about the cockpit crew
The official emphasized no final conclusions have been drawn and all the internal intelligence discussions are based on preliminary assessments of what is known to date.
Other scenarios could still emerge. The notion of a hijacking has not been ruled out, the official said.
A source close to the investigation told CNN that Malaysian police had searched the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53. Shah lives in an upscale gated community in Shah Alam, outside Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur.
Two vans were loaded with small bags, similar to shopping bags, at the home of the co-pilot, 27-year-old Farq Ab Hamid, according to a CNN crew who observed activities at the residence. It was unclear whether the bags were taken from the home, and police made no comment about their activities there.
Najib made clear in a press conference that in light of the latest developments, authorities have refocused their investigation to the crew and passengers on board.
Undoubtedly, they will scour through the flight manifest and look further to see whether any of the passengers on board had flight training or connections to terror groups.
A senior U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that investigators are carefully reviewing the information so far collected on the pilots to determine whether there is something to indicate a plan or a motive.
That would seem supported by preliminary U.S. intelligence reports, which the U.S. official said show the jetliner was in some form of controlled flight at a relatively stable altitude and path when it changed course and flew toward the Indian Ocean. It is presumed by U.S. officials to have crashed, perhaps after running out of fuel.
'Someone acting deliberately'
The first clue that perhaps one or both of the pilots were involved stem from when the plane made a sharp, deliberate turn from where it last communicated with Kuala Lumpur air traffic controllers, and before it would have to communicate with Vietnamese controllers, according to the U.S. official with knowledge of the latest intelligence thinking.
"This is the perfect place to start to disappear," the official said.
Military radar showed the jetliner flew in a westerly direction back over the Malaysian peninsula, Najib said. It is then believed to have either turned northwest toward the Bay of Bengal or southwest elsewhere in the Indian Ocean, he said.
"Evidence is consistent with someone acting deliberately from inside the plane," the Prime Minister said, officially confirming the plane's disappearance was not caused by an accident. "....Despite media reports that the plane was hijacked, we are investigating all major possibilities on what caused MH370 to deviate."
The focus of the search is now in the southern Indian Ocean. "The southern scenario seems more plausible," the official said.
Meanwhile, according to Najib, new satellite information leads authorities to be fairly certain that someone disabled the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS, just before the aircraft reached the east coast of peninsular Malaysia.
"Shortly afterward, near the border between Malaysian and Vietnamese air traffic control," Najib said, "the aircraft's transponder was switched off."
ACARS is the system that routinely transmits information like turbulence and fuel load back to the airline. A transponder is a system controlled from the cockpit that transmits data about the plane via radio signals to air traffic controllers. It combines with ground radar to provide air traffic controllers with details about the plane, including its identification, speed, position and altitude.
The last voice communication from the cockpit a week ago were these words: "All right, good night."tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-03-16T05:06:30.000Zduration=PT9M31SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=278395likes=324dislikes=50favourite=0comments=273topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]1

Deuteronomy 18:20-22
20 But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in my name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.' 21 And if you say in your heart, 'How may we know the word that the Lord has not spoken?'— 22 when a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, if the word does not come to pass or come true, that is a word that the Lord has not spoken; the prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You need not be afraid of him.

Matthew 7:15
15 "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.

Matthew 15:13-14
13 He answered, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. 14 Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit."

John 8:12
12 Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."

Video: id=q2FZayu3hHYtitle=Proof Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 landed in Diego Garcia Conspiracydescription=IN light of the recent events surrounding the ill-fated MH370 flight that disappeared from radar detection in the early hours of March 8, numerous geographic locations have come to light, and one in particular that has become a point of interest among investigators and ordinary folk is a little-known spot in the middle of the Indian Ocean called Diego Garcia.

The atoll, which takes the form of a ring shaped reef, first came to world attention in 2004 after the Asian tsunami disaster and now has resurfaced thanks to conspiracy theories that have sprung up connecting MH370 to it.

Because of its favourable ocean topography, including a deep underwater trench, the island was shielded from major damage during the 2004 tsunami. While a 1.8m-high wave did hit the island, the underwater canyon essentially bore the brunt of the assault and there was no major impact on the island's facilities or its people.tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-04-05T02:41:16.000Zduration=PT4M59SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=813220likes=980dislikes=341favourite=0comments=590topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l, /m/02ddv]1

After all the hoopla and announcements that came from a British firm Inmarsat - a UK satellite firm just days ago, the search has shifted again  by more than  1,100km to the north-east.
Five planes spot unidentified objects in a new area of the Indian Ocean being searched for flight MH370 - objects are not debris, not until connected to the flight.  More likely it is ocean garbage. 

Without a question this will go down in history as the worst aviation incident cover up - but who is behind it, who is being protected and why?

Video: id=oGNH1ixFJngtitle=Top 3 Conspiracy Theories About Malaysia Air Flight 370description=The disappearance of Malaysian Air Flight 370 has the entire world wondering what happened. How can 239 people and a Boeing 777 disappear into thin air? Most experts believe that the plane somehow suffered a catastrophic mechanical failure, but now the world is speculating possible human involvement. Here are some of the top conspiracy theories and rebuttals currently circulating in social media discussion:

The plane was shot down by the US Navy shortly after it took off.

Impossible since the engines of the plane submit real-time data through a satellite uplink. For this flight, that data was being submitted a full five hours after the takeoff of the jet.

The two Iranians or the flight crew turned off the plane's transponder and flew it to an undisclosed location.

False. The plane would have to fly through the active radar of many countries and it never showed up again on any radar.

The plane flew east and landed at a secret base, perhaps in Vietnam or the Philippines.

False. The Malaysian government tracked the plane going west. In addition, a large airstrip is required to land a 777 and such a strip would easily be seen on satellite pictures.

The plane was struck by a missile and pilots were able to send a distress call before it crashed.

False. This particular airplane is a fly-by-wire which means the pilots have direct control. The plane turned around and flew in an opposite direction than what was programmed into its flight computer. If a missile hit the cockpit of the plane, it could not turn nor could any autopilot be activated. If the pilots were all dead, the plane is programmed to continue flying and land by itself.

Aliens took the plane.

We have no answer for this one, but it is a popular source of discussion.

The plane survived and has landed somewhere and the U.S. government knows exactly where it is.

This would cause a scandal that would bring down the Obama administration and cause untold damage to the United States. Would President Obama authorize something like this which could lead to war?

Mistrust of the government, belief in aliens, or the Illuminati causing the disappearance are all theories constructed in the world of social media. The Malaysian government has officially stated that someone aboard the plane disabled critical systems. The question remains? Was it the flight crew or unknown passengers that committed this crime? In the end, the truth will come out.

Where do you even begin to look, when the search area covers vast swaths of land and water, stretching thousands of miles, from Kazakhstan to the Indian Ocean?

That's the question for Malaysian officials and authorities from 24 other nations as people search for a ninth day, trying to find Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the 239 people on board.

As the search area grows bigger, authorities are also increasing their scrutiny of the pilots, searching their homes in the quest for clues. That included a flight simulator from the captain's home.

"Police are still working on it. ... Nothing conclusive yet," a senior police official who has direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Sunday night, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak to the press.
With news that the Boeing 777-200ER may have flown for more than seven hours after its transponder stopped sending signals March 8, officials said the expanding search area extends over land in southern Asia as far north as Kazakhstan.

"This is a significant recalibration of the search," Malaysia's acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Sunday.

The plane disappeared on March 8, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The airline's CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said Sunday the missing passenger jet took off with its normal amount of fuel needed for the route, and did not have extra fuel on board that could have extended its range.

One of the nations involved in the search, Pakistan, said Sunday that the plane never showed up on its civilian radars and would have been treated as a threat if it had.

The Times of India reported that India's military also said there was no way the plane could have flown over India without being picked up on radar.

A study of the flight's cargo manifest showed there were no dangerous materials on board that concerned investigators, he told reporters.

Investigators are still looking into the backgrounds of the passengers to see if any of them were trained pilots.

"There are still a few countries who have yet to respond to our request for a background check," said Khalid Abu Bakar, inspector general of the Royal Malaysian Police Force. "But there are a few ... foreign intelligence agencies who have cleared all the(ir) passengers."

U.S. intelligence officials are leaning toward the theory that "those in the cockpit" -- the captain and co-pilot -- were responsible for the mysterious disappearance, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the latest thinking told CNN.

What we know about the cockpit crew

The official emphasized no final conclusions have been drawn and all the internal intelligence discussions are based on preliminary assessments of what is known to date.

Other scenarios could still emerge. The notion of a hijacking has not been ruled out, the official said Saturday.

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told reporters on Saturday that the plane veered off course due to apparent deliberate action taken by somebody on board.

'Someone acting deliberately'

The first clue that the captain or co-pilot may have been involved stems from when the plane made a sharp, deliberate turn just after it last communicated with Kuala Lumpur air traffic controllers, and before it would have to communicate with Vietnamese controllers, according to the U.S. official with knowledge of the latest intelligence thinking.

"This is the perfect place to start to disappear," the official said.

Adding to the intrigue, ABC News reported that the dramatic left turn was preprogrammed into the plane's navigation computer. It's a task that would have required extensive piloting experience.

Two senior law enforcement officials also told ABC that new information revealed the plane performed "tactical evasion maneuvers" after it disappeared from radar. CNN was unable to confirm these reports.

Military radar showed the jetliner flew in a westerly direction back over the Malaysian peninsula, Najib said. It is then believed to have either turned northwest toward the Bay of Bengal or southwest elsewhere in the Indian Ocean, he said.
The pilots

On Saturday, Malaysian police searched the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53. Shah lives in an upscale gated community in Shah Alam, outside Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur.

The Ministry of Transport said Sunday that police were examining a flight simulator found at the pilot's house a day earlier.

Two vans were loaded with small bags, similar to shopping bags, at the home of the co-pilot, 27-year-old Fariq Ab Hamid, according to a CNN crew who observed activities at the residence. It was unclear whether the bags were taken from the home, and police made no comment about their activities there.

Najib made clear in a press conference that in light of the latest developments...tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-03-16T19:37:11.000Zduration=PT9M32SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=51530likes=35dislikes=24favourite=0comments=60topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]1

Video: id=pn6eehNVvXEtitle=Several ground witnesses claim they saw Malaysia Airlines Flight 370description=In the middle of the night, two fishermen near the Malaysia-Thailand border saw a plane flying low over the South China Sea -- at the same time that air traffic controllers lost contact with Flight 370 over the same body of water, at 1:30 a.m. or almost 50 minutes after takeoff.
Fisherman Azid Ibrahim and a friend had taken people fishing that night off the coast of Kota Bharu.
"I was fishing when I saw the plane -- it looked strange. Flying low. I told my friend that's not normal. Normally, it flies at 35,000 feet. But that night it touched the clouds. I thought the pilot must be crazy," Ibrahim said.
"It was really low. I saw the lights they looked like the size of a coconut," he said.
Their fishing grounds lay under a flight path, but the predawn plane was unusual to see because of its low altitude, they said.
The fishermen filed a police report about their sighting, but Malaysian officials haven't commented.

Video: id=hF66rL_1jAQtitle=Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 CELL PHONE MYSTERY STRANGER THAN FICTION!description=As the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight drags into its 11th day without tangible progress, Internet sleuths are looking for answers. Any answers. From anyone.
The characteristically outspoken Courtney Love was the latest self-styled expert to weigh in with her theory last night on Twitter — which is marvelously evidence-based (!), as far as such theories go. Love, one of the thousands of people scouring crowdsourced satellite site Tomnod for signs of the plane, thinks it crashed into the ocean a mile from the small Malaysian island of Pulau Perak.
But what of the Internet's more imaginative conspiracy theorists — you know, the ones who think the Defense Department orchestrates natural disasters and 9/11 was an inside job? They have a few ideas that make Love look like a veritable aviation expert. We trawled their message boards and YouTube channels so you don't have to.
1. The plane never crashed — it's just invisible! In a twist straight out of the"Star Wars" saga, some theorists are claiming that Flight 370 deployed "electronic weaponry" and "cloaking devices" that have simply hid it from radar detection. "Today's electronic warfare (EW) capability includes weaponry that can hide planes," argues an article on the skepticism-inducing WorthyToShare.net, which sadly offers no solution to how said weaponry would get on a passenger plane.
2. Flight 370 "shadowed" another plane into Indian airspace. An Ohio IT worker/hobby aviationist named Keith Ledgerwood apparently started a Tumblr for the sole purpose of propagating this theory — with pretty decent results. His lengthy post on how the missing plane could "hide" from radar by flying close to another jet has been reblogged nearly a thousand times. "It sounds totally crazy," an aircraft accident investigator told Business Insider.
Crazy — but possible! Airplanes can indeed fly in formation. The chances of coordinating and timing such a coordination are just very, very slim.
3. The plane has been at a U.S. Navy base the whole time. The U.S. maintains a logistics base called Diego Garcia in the Chagos Archipelago. Because the Chagos Archipelago is in the Indian Ocean, and because Diego Garcia does indeed have a runway, many a theorist has joyfully concluded that the U.S. military either (a) captured the plane, (b) shot it down as it swooped in for an attack, or (c) planned to divert it to the installation all along. No one ever explains why the U.S. would take such an extraordinary measure, though The Total Collapse — a prepper Web site that predicts the apocalypse —  is convinced that the plane carried some "highly suspicious cargo" from Seychelles.
It doesn't exactly help that Diego Garcia is, per a book by American University's David Vine, "one of the most strategically important and secretive U.S. military installations outside the United States." As maps of the search area make pretty clear, however, the island is far from either of the routes suggested by Flight 370's last satellite contact — which would put it west of Perth, Australia, or above the southeast Asian mainland.
4. The plane was shot down by a hostile country that is not the U.S. This gem comes courtesy of radio host Rush Limbaugh, who posited that "some hostile country flew up there and shot it down, and then discovered their mistake and nobody wants to admit what happened," immediately after acknowledging that he had no idea "if this is possible" or not.
5. Flight 370 was hijacked by extremists — possibly jihadists — who may re-outfit the plane for an attack. None other than media mogul Rupert Murdoch has advanced the hijacking theory, arguing on Twitter that the plane is hidden, "like Bin Laden" (!), in Northern Pakistan. Others have read nefarious future plans into the hijacking, fed by a weekend report in the Telegraph that al-Qaeda may have, at one time, been planning a "9/11-style attack" with Malaysian extremists. Pakistan has said its radars never picked up a jet.
6. The flight was abducted by aliens. "You really need to consider Santa Clause here bro," retorted a user on the conspiracy forum Above Top Secret — one of many, many places where the alien/time-space continuum/wormhole theory has been proposed.
7. The Illuminati planned it — and even warned the world in a Pitbull song! Pitbull seems like an unlikely herald of the coming New World Order, but some amazingly earnest YouTube commenters insist that his 2012 song "Get It Started," featuring Shakira, alludes to the plane's disappearance. The lyrics contain a passing reference to Malaysia: "but for now it's off to Malaysia/two passports, three cities, two countries, one day."
Per the YouTube masses, the "two passports" are the two stolen passports used by Iranian passengers apparently migrating to Europe, and the three cities are Kuala Lumpur, Beijing and wherever the plane is now. Alas, Pitbull and his Illuminati masters did not think to include that third location in the song.tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-03-19T00:01:57.000Zduration=PT2M34SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=135951likes=117dislikes=31favourite=0comments=140topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]1

Video: id=szdW22mqNBQtitle=Flight 370: The Missing Links  (1080p HD)description=Discovery Channel presents a special one-hour documentary - FLIGHT 370: THE MISSING LINKS - which gathers the foremost thinkers in aviation and security to explore key questions surrounding the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. FLIGHT 370: THE MISSING LINKS will air in more than 220 countries and territories worldwide on Discovery Channel. In Southeast Asia, FLIGHT 370: THE MISSING LINKS will first air exclusively on Discovery Channel.

The mystery of flight MH370 has garnered worldwide attention and generated widespread speculation about how the events unfolded. FLIGHT 370: THE MISSING LINKS looks to industry experts to account for just how it is possible to lose track of an airliner -- analysing evidence, deliberating the global frailties of aviation and divulging potential solutions to prevent the disappearance of an aircraft from ever happening again.

In an age when we can use apps to locate handheld devices, the special also looks at how a state-of-the-art airliner and its 239 passengers and crew can simply vanish. Since flight MH370 went off the grid on 8March 2014, questions about flight safety have once again taken centre stage.

With the disappearance of those on Malaysian Airlines MH370 billionaire, Jacob Rothschild becomes the sole owner of an important semiconductor patent. 

Coincidence? I think not! The mysteries surrounding Malaysian Airliner MH-370 continue to grow with each passing day and Mr. Rothschild is smack dab in the middle.

Illuminati member, Rothschild, is believed to have exploited the airliner to gain full Patent Rights of an incredible KL-03 micro-chip. The US technological company, Freescale Semiconductor, who shared its rights with Rothschild, had twenty senior members on board who had just launched a new electronic warfare gadget for military radar system's the day before the plane went missing.




The Semiconductor company develops microprocessors, sensors, and other technology including stand-alone semiconductors that perform dedicated computing functions.

But the questions that arise are why were there so many Freescale employees traveling together? What were their jobs? Their mission? And did they employees carry valuable cargo? With all the power our elite carry, why couldn't they track down the missing plane?

Furthermore it owns Freescale RF which is involved in making solutions for Aerospace and Defense including: Battlefield communications, Avionics, HF Radar -- Band L and S, Missile Guidance, Electronic Warfare, and Identification (IFF).




But here's where it gets even more interesting. The Freescale's shareholders include the Carlyle Group who's past advisors have included ex-US president George Bush Sr and former British Prime Minister John Major. Some of the companies previous clients include the construction firm owned by the family of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Binladin Group.

The company [Freescale] did not respond to questions from Express Online, including whether any of its missing employees had been working on the defense products.

It neither provided any responses to the latest bizarre conspiracy theory being widely published on the comments sections of newspaper websites and other internet forums.

The comment reads: "It reads: "Have you pieced together the puzzle of missing flight 370 to Beijing China? If not, here are your missing pieces.

Four days after the flight MH370 disappear, semiconductor patent was approved by the U.S. patent office patent is divided in parts of 20% between five starters. One of the owners is the company itself, Freescale Semiconductor, Austin, Texas (USA), and the other four Chinese employees of the company: Peidong Wang, Zhijun Chen, Cheng and Li Ying Zhijong, all the Suzhou City. And they all passengers of Malaysia Airlines plane disappeared on March 8, according Eternity."

It adds: "Here is your motive for the missing Beijing plane. As all four Chinese members of the Patent were passengers on the missing plane."




Patent holders can alter the proceeds legally by passing wealth to their heirs. "However, they cannot do so until the Patent is approved. So when the plane went missing, the patent had not been approved."

Although a Freescale patent exists under number US8650327, none of the names listed actually appear on the passenger manifest released by the Malaysian authorities.

If the patent holder dies, the other owners share equally in dividends from the deceased. If four of the five patentees die, then the patentee left alive gets 100% of the patent. That remaining patent holder is the company Freescale Semiconductor. Who owns Freescale Semiconductor? The answer is: Jacob Rothschild. British billionaire owns the company Blackstone, which in turn owns the company Freescale Semiconductors. Several speculations on the Internet now pay attention to this circumstance. The Rothschilds are a dynasty of financiers and international bankers of German-Jewish origin . The family is from the nineteenth century one of the most influential families of bankers and financiers of Europe."

To See Patent Upclose: http://truthnewsinternational.files.w...

Is this just another coincidence? I don't think so.

Rothschild is hiding evidence to gain the rights to this semiconductor. He wants power and he wants his money! It may have taken 239 deaths to do it, but to him, that's just part of population control. In the end, he gets him money, his fame, and his power; all while the world remains silent. Makes you sick doesn't it!


Time to expose this fraud for who he is!

Video: id=6vvoRrafamgtitle=Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 'The Plane That Vanished'description=What really happened to MH370?

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370/MAS370) was a scheduled international passenger flight that disappeared on 8 March 2014, while flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing Capital International Airport in Beijing, China. Flight 370 last made voice contact with air traffic control at 01:19 MYT (17:19 UTC, 7 March) when it was over the South China Sea, less than an hour after takeoff. The aircraft disappeared from air traffic controllers' radar screens at 01:21. Malaysian military radar continued to track Flight 370 as it deviated from its planned flight path and crossed the Malay Peninsula. Flight 370 left the range of Malaysian military radar at 02:22 while over the Andaman Sea, 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) northwest of Penang in northwestern Malaysia. The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was carrying 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 15 nations.

A multinational search effort began in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea, where the flight's signal was lost on secondary surveillance radar, and was soon extended to the Strait of Malacca and Andaman Sea. Analysis of satellite communications between the aircraft and Inmarsat's satellite communications network concluded that the flight continued until at least 08:19 MYT and flew south into the southern Indian Ocean, although the precise location cannot be determined;Australia took charge of the search effort on 17 March, when the search shifted to the southern Indian Ocean. On 24 March 2014, the Malaysian government, noting that the final location determined by the satellite communication is far from any possible landing sites, concluded that "flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean." The current phase of the search is a comprehensive search of the seafloor about 1,800 kilometres (1,100 mi) southwest of Perth, Australia, which began in October 2014. Despite being the largest and most expensive search in aviation history, there has been no confirmation of any flight debris, resulting in speculations about its disappearance.

Malaysia established the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to investigate the incident, working with foreign aviation authorities and experts. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished. Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were initially suspect in the disappearance, but they were later determined to be asylum seekers and terrorism has been ruled out. Malaysian police have identified the Captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all other passengers of any suspicious motives. Power was lost to the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat's satellite communication network at 02:25—three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar. Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of Sumatra and flew for five hours without communication and with little deviation in its track, suggesting that the aircraft was flying on autopilot without manual input from the cockpit and that Flight 370 may have experienced a hypoxia event, ending when fuel was exhausted.

At the time of its disappearance, and if the presumed loss of all on board is confirmed, Flight 370 was the deadliest aviation incident in Malaysia Airlines' history and the deadliest involving a Boeing 777. It was surpassed in both regards 131 days later by the crash of another Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 – Flight 17 – that was shot down over Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines was struggling financially, a problem which was exacerbated by a decline in ticket sales after Flight 370 disappeared and before the crash of Flight 17; the airline was renationalised by the end of 2014. The Malaysian government received significant criticism, especially from China, for failing to disclose information in a timely manner during the early weeks of the search. Flight 370's disappearance brought to the public's attention the limits of aircraft tracking and flight recorders, including several issues raised four years earlier - but never mandated - following the loss of Air France Flight 447. A task force set up by the International Air Transport Association, with the support of the International Civil Aviation Organization, proposed a new standard that, by December 2015, commercial aircraft report their positions every 15 minutes. The Malaysian Ministry of Transport issued an interim report on 8 March 2015.tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-05T23:01:56.000Zduration=PT50M25SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=3088likes=37dislikes=2favourite=0comments=10topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/05czz6l, /m/0bqkj3, /m/015xf8, /m/013_0l]0

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: "Patents Patents Patents?"

"Have you pieced together the puzzle of missing flight 370 to Beijing China ?
If not, here are your missing pieces.

Patents Patents Patents

4 days after the missing flight MH370 a patent is approved by the Patent 
Office, 4 of the 5 Patent holders are Chinese employees of Freescale 
Semiconductor of Austin TX.

Patent is divided up on 20% increments to 5 holders.

    Peidong Wang, Suzhou, China, (20%)
   Zhijun Chen, Suzhou, China, (20%)
   Zhihong Cheng, Suzhou, China, (20%)
   Li Ying, Suzhou, China, (20%)
   Freescale Semiconductor (20%)

If a patent holder dies, then the remaining holders equally share the dividends of the deceased if not disputed in a will.
If 4 of the 5 dies, then the remaining 1 Patent holder gets 100% of the wealth of the patent.

That remaining live Patent holder is Freescale Semiconductor.
Who owns Freescale Semiconductor ??
Jacob Rothschild through Blackstone who owns Freescale.
Here is your motive for the missing Beijing plane.
As all 4 Chinese members of the Patent were passengers on the missing plane.

Patent holders can alter the proceeds legally by passing wealth to their 
heirs. However, they cannot do so until the Patent is approved. So when the 
plane went missing, the patent had not been approved.

Thus, Rothschild gets 100% of Patent once Patent holders declared 
deceased."

The patent that got this online message started is this one, US 008671381, 
from March 11, 2014:
Saved copy: http://truthnewsinternational.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/us008671381.pdf
    Original: A, B

The names listed on the patent, i.e. Wang Peidong, Chen Zhijun, Cheng Zhihong 
and Ying Li are the same as in the online message. However, according to the 
March 8, 2014, passenger manifest(original) of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 
these persons were not on that plane. If they were then their names are not 
listed. 

Were there Freescale employees on board? Yes. And also at least one from IBM.
Is Freescale Semiconductor owned by Blackstone?

On April 27, 2013, Bloomberg published an article about the company in 
which it is confirmed that Freescale is indeed a Blackstone venture:
 
"Blackstone-Owned Freescale Rises as Forecast Tops Estimates: Freescale 
Semiconductor Ltd. (FSL), the chipmaker mostly owned by a private-equity group 
including Blackstone Group LP (BX) and TPG Capital, rose after predicting 
second-quarter sales that may exceed some analysts' estimates."

Is Rothschild linked to Blackstone? Yes, he is a Member of the 
International Advisory Board.
Is Blackstone one of the parties who are responsible for the missing 
airplane, flight 370?
 
The answer to that question can likely only come from those who 
ordered/organized the AWACS mission of March 8, 2014.

awacs, ecm, electronic counter measure, The electronic counter measure (ECM) capability aboard the AWACS allows its user to jam radar frequencies and communications of the enemy radar

Aside from the patent message that is circulating online, here are some other links to photos and info that one may find interesting to copy and save for future reference, for you never know how data and narratives might change since the photos of the "suspects" were horribly FAKED, on purpose of course.

Video: id=QOJIwVuMhqMtitle=Top 5 Leading theories about Malaysia Airlines flight 370description=Top 5 Leading theories about Malaysia Airlines flight 370. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 leaves everybody wondering. What happened?

5. The pilot committed suicide

Though uncommon, there have been 24 cases of in-flight pilot suicide over the last two decades. SilkAir Flight 185 and EgyptAir Flight 990 are the two commonly cited examples of this type of tragedy. In both cases, investigators concluded that the pilots deliberately caused the crashes.

4. Financial motive

The disappearance of the flight may be the result of psychological or personal problems of someone on board, said police chief Bakar. "Maybe somebody on the flight has bought a huge sum of insurance, who wants family to gain from it or somebody who has owed somebody so much money," he proposed at a news conference days after the plane vanished.

3. Sabotage

Given reports that the plane's communications transponders were deliberately turned off — one after the other — investigators believe sabotage is a possibility. Someone on board seemingly changed the plane's course — and deliberately masked its location from radar systems. Turning off the plane's transponder "would require disabling a circuit breaker above and behind an overhead panel. Pilots rarely, if ever, need to access the circuit breakers, which are reserved for maintenance personnel."

2. Hijacked

Police chief Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters that the criminal investigation was now focused on four possible scenarios, one of which is a hijacking. If it was hijacked, though, what was the plan? That much, investigators don't know. Most hijackings end with a ransom exchange or, as we saw on 9/11, a much more public display of destruction. MH370, it appears, ended in the Indian Ocean, or did it...?

1. A catastrophic event

Satellite data showed that the plane flew off radar for up to seven hours — meaning that the plane continued traveling until its fuel ran out. It's possible that everyone on board was unconscious or dead due to explosives or rapid or slow decompression, which can occur from a number of instances while traveling in an aircraft. If they ran out of oxygen the plane possibly continued to fly on autopilot for hours and could have crashed anywhere after running out of fuel.
