Video: id=ZoJ2fM5rCy8title=ED FULL SPECS HANDS ON GIZMODO - APPLE  4G IPHONE LEAKED AND REVEALED!!!!description=THE NEXT IPHONE WAS LEAKED AND THIS GUY GOT IT!!!. . Read the story:. http://gizmodo.com/5520164/this-is-apples-next-iphone. . Summary:. The next apple iphone 4g was leaked!!. An apple associate lost the apple iphone 4g prototype at a bar and someone picked it up.. . . What's new. . • Front-facing video chat camera. • Improved regular back-camera (the lens is quite noticeably larger than the iPhone 3GS). • Camera flash. • Micro-SIM instead of standard SIM (like the iPad). • Improved display. It's unclear if it's the 960x640 display thrown around before—it certainly looks like it, with the "Connect to iTunes" screen displaying much higher resolution than on a 3GS.. • What looks to be a secondary mic for noise cancellation, at the top, next to the headphone jack. • Split buttons for volume. • Power, mute, and volume buttons are all metallic. . . . . What's changed. . • The back is entirely flat, made of either glass (more likely) or ceramic or shiny plastic in order for the cell signal to poke through. Tapping on the back makes a more hollow and higher pitched sound compared to tapping on the glass on the front/screen, but that could just be the orientation of components inside making for a different sound. • An aluminum border going completely around the outside. • Slightly smaller screen than the 3GS (but seemingly higher resolution). • Everything is more squared off. • 3 grams heavier. • 16% Larger battery. • Internals components are shrunken, miniaturized and reduced to make room for the larger batterytags=nullpublishedAt=2010-04-22T23:36:34.000Zduration=PT1M4SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=1806likes=3dislikes=0favourite=0comments=2topicIds=[/m/027lnzs, /m/0k8z]1

Video: id=6VL8G6PO35stitle=Apple Watch sells millions, Sony Xperia Z4 leaks, iPhone 7 materials & more - Pocketnow Dailydescription=Stories:
- Microsoft halts Windows 10 Technical Preview availability for select Lumia models http://pocketnow.com/2015/04/16/windows-10-preview-bug
- New Sony Xperia Z4 leaks claim new design, features, and launch date http://pocketnow.com/2015/04/16/sony-xperia-z4-all-metal
- More iPad Pro leaks point to an additional USB Type-C port http://pocketnow.com/2015/04/16/ipad-pro-usb-type-c

- Analysts predict 2.3M Apple Watch units preordered; Sport sold the most http://pocketnow.com/2015/04/16/2-3-million-apple-watch-sales

Watch today's Pocketnow Daily as we talk about Microsoft's halt of Windows 10 preview for smartphones due to a couple of significant bugs. Sony then takes the stage as the Xperia Z4 continues to be alive, and this time leaks point to new materials. Then we talk about the next iPhone, and how it might bring stronger materials in design. We end today's show talking about some predictions that claim that the Apple Watch sold in the millions.

All this and more after the break.

Video: id=WHOX9iH5wGktitle=iPhone 5S Leaked Pictures + Other Rumorsdescription=Alright guys it's time to talk rumors. In the first part of this video we're going to talk about what the blogs have been buzzing about, and in the second part, what we would LIKE to see from the next iPhone. All of these rumors are unconfirmed, so take them with a grain of salt.

First of all, most analysts have ruled out the possibility of the iPhone 6 dropping this year, so it's everyone's best guess that the phone coming out will be the iPhone 5S. Most rumors have pointed to a May or June announcement, and a June or July launch of the new phone.

Next up, here's a weird one: a Chinese technology site recently published pictures of what they claim to be new handsets right off of Foxconn's production line.  Based on the images and other reports, analysts have speculated that Apple will be releasing a less expensive version of the iPhone, using a plastic back instead of all metal construction. Which, coming from Apple, would be a highly puzzling move, to say the least.

Those are the two most persistent rumors at the moment so far at least. What we're more interested in is talking about the competitive landscape of smartphones these days. With Samsung Galaxy consistently bringing the heat and the Xperia Z, HTC One, and even Blackberry Z10 drawing a lot of attention, it's clear that Apple is going to have to do SOMETHING interesting in the future. Because consumers have pretty much gone numb to slight megapixel bumps in the camera, faster processors, more ram, and higher res screens by now. Those things are no longer surprises, they're expectations - you're not winning if you do them, but you are losing if you don't.

So we have to ask the question: what new features would Apple have to add to the phone to get you excited about the 5S? NFC support, better speakers, a huge leap in camera quality, 2-day battery life, a life-size cyborg version of Siri with every purchase? Seriously though, let's say you're a proud Galaxy S3 owner, what would Apple have to put in their new handset to make you consider switching? Let us know in the comments, and we'll see you guys next time, on AskMen.tags=nullpublishedAt=2013-03-05T22:44:57.000Zduration=PT1M44SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=10896likes=86dislikes=8favourite=0comments=61topicIds=[/m/027lnzs, /m/0w_ghcf, /m/0gg4gh4]

iPhone 6 Leaked Apple Logo for Notifications - Official Information and iPhone 5 pre-Release rear Shell, as well as additional written information concerning the next-generation iPhone can be found here: http://www.besttechinfo.com/apple/iphone-6-truth-about-glowing-apple-logo-notifications

The Next Generation iPhone ( iPhone 6 ) will, unfortunately, lack a glowing LED Apple logo assembly for the reasons mentioned in this video. However, we’ve taken the time to provide you with a quick glimpse of how such a system may look if Apple opts to implement the feature for future iPhone generations past the iPhone 6! 

Additional Leaked iPhone 6 images, including high-resolution shots of all aspects of the upcoming device, and the primary design changes, are available on Evasi0n Jailbreak: http://www.evasi0njailbreak.com/iphone-6-leaked-housing-hd-gallery-evasi0n-jailbreak
