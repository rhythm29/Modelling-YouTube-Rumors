Video: id=bnGjZMjEgVwtitle=Walter Scott Shooting, Officer Michael Slager Charged | True Newsdescription=Officer Michael Slager pulled over Walter Scott in a routine South Carolina traffic stop - and the events which followed left Walter Scott dead and Officer Slager charged with murder and stripped of his badge.

Video: id=z1gFBN-Ertstitle=Walter Scott Police Shooting 'Tore My Heart to Pieces,' Victim's Mother Saysdescription=Walter Scott Police Shooting 'Tore My Heart to Pieces,' Victim's Mother Says

The relatives of an unarmed South Carolina man who was shot in the back and killed by a police officer said they are devastated by the tragedy – and hope that justice and healing can emerge.

North Charleston officer Michael Slager was charged in the Saturday morning shooting death of Walter “Lamar” Scott, 50, which was captured on video by an unidentified witness. A magistrate denied Slager bond at a hearing Tuesday evening and he was being held at the Charleston County Detention Center.

Judy Scott, the victim’s mother, said her son was a caring person, someone who still called her “Mommy” in adulthood and was raised in the church.

“When I looked at that tape, that was the most horrible thing I’ve ever seen. I am very, very upset concerning it. I almost couldn’t look at it. To see my son running, defenselessly being shot, it just tore my heart to pieces,” she said on "Good Morning America" today.

Judy Scott said her faith has sustained her during her time of mourning.

“I feel sad for the officer who did the shooting, because he’s gonna have to give account for that. And I pray that he would repent to the Lord for what has happened, and we cannot move and act so quickly, we have to think before we take action and remember that we all have … that’s my son. And I’ve lost a son that will never come back. We have his memories, but he will never come back. And I pray that this never happens to anybody else,” she said.

The victim’s brother Anthony Scott said the murder charge was a positive development, but ultimately comes with mixed emotions.

“It is unusual right now, but I feel like we have a little bit more of the process to do. A charge is not being convicted,” Anthony Scott said. “Once a conviction is put in place, I’ll feel a whole lot better.”

Scott had four children. The family says it will file a civil suit.tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-08T14:51:25.000Zduration=PT6M12SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=5393likes=22dislikes=10favourite=0comments=47topicIds=null0

In an exclusive interview with "NBC Nightly News" anchor Lester Holt on Wednesday, Feidin Santana said he started recording after he heard a Taser being deployed. 
"They were down on the floor before I started recording. I remember the police had control of the situation," Santana said. "He had control of Scott. And Scott was trying just to get away from the Taser." 
"As you can see in the video, the police officer just shot him in the back," Santana said. "I knew right away, I had something on my hands." 
SC Cop Faces Murder Charge After Video Shows Him Fatally Shoot Unarmed Black Man in Back As He Runs Away
North Charleston officer to face murder charge after video shows him shooting man in back
(The Post And Courier) A video that shows a North Charleston police officer shooting at 50-year-old Walter Scott’s back at least eight times as he ran away resulted in the lawman’s arrest Tuesday, officials said. 
The development came as the State Law Enforcement Division looked into whether Patrolman 1st Class Michael Slager, 33, acted lawfully when he shot Scott to death. 

Police Chief Eddie Driggers said Tuesday that Slager had been arrested.
Mayor Keith Summey added during a news conference that as a result of the video and Slager’s “bad decision,” the officer would be charged with murder. 

Summey said Slager’s actions were not representative of the entire police force. 

“When you’re wrong, you’re wrong,” Summey said. “When you make a bad decision, don’t care if you’re behind the shield or a citizen on the street, you have to live with that decision.” 

The footage, filmed by an anonymous bystander, shows the end of the confrontation between the two on Saturday after Scott, who had a warrant out for his arrest, ran from a traffic stop. It was the first piece of evidence that could contradict a statement that Slager released to the public through his attorney. 

SLED spokesman Thom Berry said Tuesday that he could not confirm whether the agency has the video. 

“All I can say is that our investigation is continuing,” Berry said, “and it would be inappropriate for us to discuss any specifics at this time.” 

Attorney David Aylor, who released a statement on Slager’s behalf earlier this week, said Tuesday that he wasn’t representing the officer anymore. 

“I’m no longer involved in form or fashion,” Aylor said. 

Slager has said through Aylor that Scott had wrested his Taser from him during a struggle. The officer felt threatened when he fired, his attorney said. 

Deputy Coroner Brittney Martin was not immediately available Tuesday to confirm how many times Scott was hit. 

At the time, Scott was wanted for arrest on a Family Court warrant, Charleston County sheriff’s Maj. Eric Watson said Tuesday. 

He had a history of arrests related to contempt of court charges for failing to pay child support. The only accusation of violence against Scott during his lifetime came through a 1987 assault and battery charge, but the disposition of that charge was not immediately known. 

Public sentiment

The footage comes amid a discussion about race and policing in the U.S. 

Scott was black. Slager is white. 

The nationwide conversation was sparked by the fatal shooting in August of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Brown, an 18-year-old black man, was unarmed at the time, but witnesses said he got into a struggle with Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, and was shot during the scuffle. 

Though a grand jury did not find any reason to indict Wilson, the shooting ignited protests, some of which turned violent. A “black lives matter” movement inspired talk about whether police nationwide too quickly resort to deadly force against black men. 

During that wave of public sentiment that prompted rallies in the Charleston area, South Carolina Trooper Sean Groubert, who is white, was arrested for shooting Levar Jones, a black man who had reached into his pickup for his driver’s license during a September traffic stop in Columbia. Groubert faces a charge of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, and the state settled a lawsuit by Jones for $300,000.

Video: id=9xbilaD6sWAtitle='HERO' Bystander Who Recorded Shooting Of Walter Scott Speaks Out - Feidin Santana INTERVIEWdescription=The bystander who captured on video a white police officer shooting an apparently unarmed black man in the back in South Carolina thought about erasing the recording over fears of retaliation.

The video recorded by Feidin Santana shocked the nation when it was released this week. The footage resulted in Officer Michael Slager, 33, being arrested and charged with murder Tuesday for the shooting death of Walter Scott, 50, after a traffic stop in North Charleston Saturday.

"I won't deny that I knew the magnitude of this, and I even thought about erasing the video," Santana said in an interview on MSNBC's "All In With Chris Hayes" Wednesday.

"I felt that my life, with this information, might be in danger. I thought about erasing the video and just getting out of the community, you know Charleston, and living some place else," the 23-year-old said. "I knew the cop didn't do the right thing."

Video: id=0kp_B911F_Qtitle=The Execution Of Walter Scott: Why We Need To Film Policedescription=On Holy Saturday April 4, 2015. While the good people of City of North Charleston, South Carolina reflected on the meaning of the day before Easter. Walter Scott, a 50 year old Veteran of the Coast Guard and Father of four was running for his life because of a broken tail light and a warrant for child support backpay.

33 year old Officer Michael T. Slager immediately claimed he feared for his life in a 911 call because Scott had taken the stun gun from him in a scuffle. The video clearly tells a completely different story, as Officer Slager plants the stun gun next to Scott’s face down and limp handcuffed body in full view of another officer. Who needs to be investigated as well.

The law worked, because the surveillance state works both ways. And after reviewing the video, unlike the outcome of the blatant death of Eric Garner, the good people of North Charlotte knew what happened was wrong. The scales of Law and order were honored rather than ignored. And it didn’t take a multi million dollar routing of liberty like the Department Of Justice's Unconstitutional COPS program to make it happen. Its real simple,The system works when its not being violated.

Scott was shot in the back eight times while fleeing a police officer after a traffic stop went horribly wrong.

We have thousands of police officers entrusted with other people’s lives every day, but when the worst case scenario hits of them abusing that power, we do not have a system in place that ensures we will know what happened. In fact, when the worst case scenario hits of an officer abusing their power, that’s precisely when it’s most likely we will have to take that officers word for what happened unless one of us just happens to be there recording.tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-08T17:21:48.000Zduration=PT4M20SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=37438likes=493dislikes=16favourite=0comments=133topicIds=null0

Video: id=QBRY6VsNsL8title=The Brilliant Idiots: Charlamagne & Andrew Schulz Talk Walter Scott Case & Racismdescription=http://www.vladtv.com - On their most recent Brilliant Idiots podcast, Charlamagne Tha God and Andrew Schulz talk about racism, injustices in the police system and the killing of Walter Scott.

Charlamagne touched on the problems with racism in today's modern world and also sided with actor Isaiah Washington's comments on adapting to people who are a different race. The radio show hosts says he understands the actor's views and in some scenarios he has even gone out of his way to make older women of other races feels comfortable.

When it comes to breaking the ice with people from different worlds, Charlamagne says that many people try to break the ice with him by relating to Hip Hop culture. Some of his stories included older white people singing Hip Hop tunes like ILoveMakonnen's "Tuesday" or conversations about the hit TV show, Empire.

The hosts also talked about Walter Scott and the different practices done in police departments all over the country.

Video: id=6Lwwn-jNaqktitle=4/09/2015 -- Walter L. Scott Jr. Police Shooting Hoax-- FAKE ADDRESS + IDENTITYdescription=This is weird.  After becoming curious about the validity of this supposed "shooting" of Walter L. Scott Jr. from Charleston South Carolina -- I did a search on who Walter Scott was.

After doing multiple searches, I found the radaris and white pages information associated with the only 50yr old Walter L. Scott Jr. who turned up.

Up comes this address:

214 Dogwood Trail Harleyville, SC 29448-3937


If you search that address, the top search return is a known fake identity address !  Complete with fake social security number and fake fraudulent credit card #'s  listed on a website???!!!!!  Supposedly generated by the website to "protect" from identity theft?  Supposedly randomly generated, however each time you search the address the SAME "randomly" generated information comes up.  So.. is it randomly generated only  once??  Like I said, this is weird.

Is Walter L. Scott Jr. from Harleyville, or is that just a fake address he used (just outside of Charleston SC?)

Wow, really?

Video: id=Gm7NYbHIzTwtitle=The Video Execution of Walter Scottdescription=Forget anything and everything you’ve heard or thought about police shootings. This isn’t Ferguson or Michael Brown or Eric Garner or even Tamir Rice or even Akai Gurley. Those cases involved at least the initial argument that a suspect/perp did something that might have warranted an officer’s activities. Michael Brown menaced Officer Darren Wilson. Eric Garner resisted arrest and died from the rigors of the arrest process and not being shot or beaten. This case is different. Walter Scott was executed by an officer who never apparently thought of giving chase. No argument could be made that this man posed a hreat as he merely ran away and never even looked back, nothing furtive or threatening in the least.

We don’t need no stinkin’ grand jury. This North Charleston police officer, now charged with murder, decided he wasn’t going to give chase to a 50 year-old, out of shape traffic and child support miscreant. No, siree! Give chase?! Are you kidding? This cop violated every known rule of police pursuit known to mankind without exception. “When you’re wrong, you’re wrong,” North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey said, announcing the arrest. “When you make a bad decision, I don’t care if you’re behind the shield or a citizen on the street, you have to live with that decision.” It will be a tutorial in police academies (I hope) for generations to come.

Video: id=-PYoJecwyhYtitle=Savage South Carolina Cop Arrested For Murder;Shoots Walter L.Scott Multiple Times In The Backdescription=The officer, Michael T. Slager, 33, said he had feared for his life because the man had taken his stun gun in a scuffle after a traffic stop on Saturday. A video, however, shows the officer firing eight times as the man, Walter L. Scott, 50, fled. The North Charleston mayor announced the state charges at a news conference Tuesday evening.

The shooting came on the heels of high-profile instances of police officers’ using lethal force in New York, Cleveland, Ferguson, Mo., and elsewhere. The deaths have set off a national debate over whether the police are too quick to use force, particularly in cases involving black men.
A White House task force has recommended a host of changes to the nation’s police policies, and President Obama sent Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to cities around the country to try to improve police relations with minority neighborhoods.

Video: id=65m_e_1yzQktitle=Hannity DEFENDS Walter Scott From Guest.. WTF??description=Hannity DEFENDS Walter Scott From Rev Jesse Lee Peterson. One of Sean Hannity‘s guests tonight got so pissed off in the middle of a heated argument on the Walter Scott shooting that he just up and left entirely.

Leo Terrell, who’s blown up several times on Hannity’s show before, got really angry with Reverend Jesse Lee Peterson after he said people need to “stop overreacting” in cases like the Scott shooting, because of how much people overreacted in the cases of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown.

He shouted, “I am not going to sit here and listen to this hate! I’m not gonna listen to it!”

Hannity tried to calm things down and actually sided with Terrell, but when Terrell spoke again, the second Peterson piped up, Terrell flipped out again and shouted, “You quiet down! I’m done! I’m done!”

And then, he just left.

When Hannity told this to Peterson, the reverend said, “Leo’s a little coward.”

Video: id=a6q_t0Azungtitle=Fox’s Napolitano on Walter Scott Shooting: ‘This Is What People Said Ferguson Was’description=As yet another shooting of an apparently unarmed black man by a white police officer threatened to revive the tensions over the shooting in Ferguson, Judge Andrew Napolitano strongly distinguished the two cases on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning.

“This is not Ferguson,” Napolitano said. “In Ferguson, there was a bona fide fight over the officer’s gun and the officer won the fight. This is two disparate cases. This is a victim running away from the police, shot in the back. This is what some people said Ferguson was, but it turned out it wasn’t.”

Walter Scott was shot five times in the back Saturday morning after fleeing from Officer Michael Slager during a scuffle following a traffic stop. Though Slager later said Scott had attempted to take his stun gun and that he feared for his life, video showed Scott running away from the officer, who was then apparently seen planting the taser next to Scott’s body.

Slager was charged with murder yesterday. Napolitano said it was unheard of to charge an officer that quickly, and to deny him bail.tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-08T17:07:16.000Zduration=PT5M44SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=1435likes=1dislikes=2favourite=0comments=5topicIds=[/m/05g7p6]1

Video: id=vCze-OqnEjAtitle=Cops Planting Evidence Standard Operating Procedure?description=Cenk Uygur (http://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur) host of The Young Turks discusses the comments from a Fox Legal Analyst that said it used to be standard operating procedure for police to plant evidence on a suspect to guarantee a conviction. 

"The shooting of Walter Scott by Officer Michael Slager went viral after a video that suggests Slager was attempting to plant evidence at the time of the shooting. Fox & Friends weighed in, brining on legal analyst Arthur Aidala who told everyone that it used to be standard operating procedure for police to leave evidence around a killed suspect so that the officers could avoid an investigation. Brian Kilmeade was quick to add that in the age of smartphones it was unlikely that this was still the case."

Do you think that planting evidence is standard operation procedure for police? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.
