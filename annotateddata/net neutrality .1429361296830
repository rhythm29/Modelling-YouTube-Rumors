Video: id=w-l-q7nEaxgtitle=Firms vs free web: Net neutrality at risk?description=Should telecom companies decide which sites are free and which sites are paid? Shouldn't we, as users, be allowed to go online to whatever site we want to? In other words, should there be net neutrality? It's a raging debate after Flipkart, one of India's most iconic startups, finds itself in the midst of a controversy over whether its agreement with Airtel Zero violates the principle of net neutrality. Under the agreement, Airtel users would incur no charges for using the Flipkart app with the company reimbursing Airtel directly for this. Critics argue that this alters the nature of the Internet as a leveler where big players like Flipkart and smaller companies have equal access to consumers.

Video: id=qpc32eCeh-otitle=Bangalore reacts to Net Neutrality. #RightToPlaydescription=Visit https://www.savetheinternet.in/

A nation of a billion people face an issue that might change the way we use the internet forever, but in a city like Bengaluru which is home to few of India's best internet startups, less than a few people actually knew about it. What nobody understands is that the corporations with vested interests are for people's ignorance regarding this issue.

A billion thanks to the people who appeared in the video and bravely spoke of their stand on Net Neutrality. Of course everything was said/done in good spirit. Teewe is not associated with any political organisation, we are just polarised towards an open and free internet.

We are all children of the internet and mother is in Peril.

Net neutrality (also network neutrality or Internet neutrality) is the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, and modes of communication.

Net Neutrality is extremely important to promote technological innovation, boost economic progress, and to ensure that we don't lose a medium of free speech and thought.

The Indian telecom regulator (TRAI) has proposed 20 questions for your views on two basic topics:
a. Should there be licensing of Internet services, and
b. Should there be non-discrimination of Internet access via telecom operators.

Please act before 24th April, 2015 and send your views to - advqos@trai.gov.in.

Video: id=5f3cChVh3UMtitle=WE WON! Net Neutrality and Re-Thinking Cynicismdescription=Winning in politics is often bizarre, drawn out, incremental, and ultimately a surprise. As such, winning often doesn't feel that good. But I think it's very important to take a bit of time when it happens to enjoy it. 

And also to recognize that the win would not have happened without the people who worked hard to lobby and bug their congresspeople and force a decision down the throat of a bunch of unhappy corporations. So thank you so much to everyone who campaigned to keep the internet neutral.

Video: id=4WLzYQvMv5gtitle=Hitler reacts to Net Neutrality violation in India #netneutralityindiadescription=(post by /u/shrik450 on reddit: http://redd.it/30lz1p)

If you haven't heard yet, the TRAI wants to allow telecos to regulate OTT services such as WhatsApp, Skype or Viber. While this does not directly imply that shit has hit the fan, it could allow Telecos to charge you seperately for each WhatsApp message, or make you pay equivalent charges for Skype calls etc.

Why should I take your word for this?

Here are some news and editorial articles on this:

medianama: 
http://www.medianama.com/2015/03/223-should-india-have-licensing-of-internet-services-net-neutrality-trai-wants-your-views/

Indian Express: http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/trai-seeks-to-regulate-ott-players-like-skype-viber-whatsapp-and-google-talk/

Wait, you lied to me! The TRAI wants my opinion on this!

Okay, So what should I do?

As you've read (and I hope you've read that), the TRAI wants your opinion on this. Shit hasn't hit the fan yet, and we can turn this around before this actually becomes a serious consideration. So, the first thing you can do is to e-mail the TRAI on their comments email, which is : advqos@trai.gov.in You probably shouldn't copypasta someone else's email on this as it will lead to them beleiving that a few people are spamming their inbox. Some tooltips on what to write would be:

Some tooltips on what to write would be:

- Refer to the recent Net Neutrality agitation, and the subsequent FCC ruling,
- Talk about how loss of revenue to Telecos should not be the bar to progress,
- Talk about how Net Neutrality laws have already been enacted in The Netherlands after a similar agitation there,
- If you want to, talk about how rulings in favour of allowing said regulation are anti-development, and not what you expect from the Government.

What else can I do?

You can tweet the issue out and raise publicity. Since this ruling affects widely used services such as WhatsApp and Skype, more people should be willing to listen.

Dude all this takes too long.

Well, yeah, you can either take 5 minutes now or bitch endlessly later. It's your choice.

The Debaters:
Against
James Assey - Executive Vice President, National Cable and Telecommunications Association
Robert Quinn - Senior Vice President-Federal Regulatory, AT&T
Christopher Yoo - Professor of Law and Communication; Director, Center for Technology, Innovation, and Competition, UPenn Law

For:
Tim Wu - Coined the term "Net Neutrality"; Professor of Law, Columbia Law
Brad Burnham - VC, Union Square Ventures
Nicholas Economides - Professor of Economics, Stern School of Business, New York University

This debate is not a panel discussion or a lecture.  It is a contest, and at its conclusion there will be a winner.  Before the event, the audience will vote whether they are for the motion, against the motion, or undecided.  The audience will vote again at the conclusion of the debate.  The side that has moved the most votes will be declared the winner.

This event was made possible by: Google, Verizon, IAC, and the Web 2.0 Expo.tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-12-16T11:50:43.000Zduration=PT1H42M26SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=801likes=7dislikes=0favourite=0comments=2topicIds=[/m/04zdxn]0

Video: id=-ErsLyxYm4otitle=Net Neutrality Wins Big & Why You Should Celebratedescription="Internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile must now act in the "public interest" when providing a mobile connection to your home or phone, under rules approved Thursday by a divided Federal Communications Commission.

The plan, which puts the Internet in the same regulatory camp as the telephone and bans business practices that are "unjust or unreasonable," represents the biggest regulatory shakeup to the industry in almost two decades. The goal is to prevent providers from slowing or blocking web traffic, or creating paid “fast lanes” on the Internet, said FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler.

The 3-2 vote was expected to trigger industry lawsuits that could take several years to resolve. Still, consumer advocates cheered the regulations as a victory for smaller Internet-based companies, who had feared they would have to pay "tolls" to move their content."* The Young Turks hosts Cenk Uygur & John Iadarola break it down.

Video: id=lho2KuFFxe4title=GOP Heads Explode Over Obama’s Net Neutrality Announcementdescription="Never missing an opportunity to remind America how much he resents Obamacare, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took to Twitter Monday to lash out against President Barack Obama's net neutrality endorsement by comparing it to the health care law.

Earlier Monday, Obama urged the Federal Communications Commission to "implement the strongest possible rules" to protect a free and open Internet in a video message and written statement.

Cruz, who has openly opposed the FCC's role in modernizing telecommunications laws, responded to the president's statement on Twitter"* The Young Turks host Cenk Uygur breaks it down.

Video: id=7YcwfZEurU0title=Obama Proposes Surprisingly Strong Net Neutrality Lawsdescription="U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday said Internet service providers should be regulated more like public utilities to make sure they grant equal access to all content providers, touching off intense protests from cable and telecoms companies and Republican lawmakers.

Obama's detailed statement on the issue of "net neutrality," a platform in his 2008 presidential campaign, was a rare intervention by the White House into the policy setting of an independent agency.

Shares of major Internet service providers Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable Inc (TWC.N) fell sharply after Obama said ISPs should be reclassified to face stricter regulations and banned from striking paid "fast lane" deals with content companies."* The Young Turks host Cenk Uygur breaks it down.

Video: id=00ho5pMrc4ctitle=Net Neutrality Neuters the Internetdescription=Proponents of net neutrality claim that it is necessary to keep the Internet “free” and functioning the way it was designed. Steve Simpson discusses why these claims are nonsensical and explains how net neutrality will end up making the Internet function more like a government-run utility than the vibrant marketplace and font of innovation it has been for the last two decades.

Video: id=vxaFnc-MoVEtitle=AIB - Net Neutrality (Save the Internet)  #IndiaWantsNetNeutralitydescription=AIB Is Back. And This Time, They’re Talking On Something We Should All Worry About.
All India Bakchod is back, but with a rather important message: We need to help keep the internet a free space for all of us.

Yes, they’re here to talk about Net Neutrality, and just how much of a concern it should be for the public. If you’re even a little bit confused about what net neutrality is, and why you should care about it, this video will clear things up for you. With their analogies that are absolutely spot-on, you’ll understand why you need to fight telecom operators who are going to make you pay for the websites you use by controlling the speed of your internet connection or providing paid partner services free of cost.

We need to fight this. Because the internet is a free space, and no one should be allowed to make a business out of it.

Tell the FCC that they should reclassify broadband internet as a telecommunications (or "Common carrier") service. Right now broadband is regulated like TV or radio, which doesn't make sense. 

This is a public comment for the public record...official government stuff... so you'll have to include your actual name and address.

Video: id=6IAqN3_waBAtitle=Tanmay Bhat of 'AIB' on Net Neutrality Debate - The Newshour Debate: Fight for free internetdescription=Amid a raging debate over equal Internet access for all, the Government on Monday (April 13) threw its weight behind "non-discriminatory internet access" and said an expert panel is looking into the 'net neutrality' issue. Anti-trust watchdog CCI might also launch a probe into schemes launched by some telecom operators, including Airtel, Reliance Communications and Uninor, that claim to provide 'free' access to certain internet applications, even as the companies defended their stand saying these initiatives did not go against 'net neutrality'. Social media platforms like Twitter continued to remain abuzz, as politicians, filmstars, start-ups and corporates joined the debate, while Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also said there needs to be a debate on the issue. Net neutrality implies equal treatment to all Internet traffic and any priority given to an application or company on payment basis is seen as violating the concept. Telecom regulator TRAI, which last month floated a discussion paper on this, is also looking into the issue. "Non discriminatory net availability is what we need to strive for," Telecom and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, while adding that an expert committee was looking into the matter and should submit its report within a month to help the government make an informed decision.

According to the Minister, Internet is one of the finest creations of the human mind and it is a property of the entire human race and not of any country or society. "Internet to become entirely global should have a link to local and when we talk of digital inclusion it must be available to the underprivileged and on the margins," he said. Sparking off the debate, telecom major Bharti Airtel launched its 'Airtel Zero' marketing platform -- where certain apps are available for free with charges borne by app makers. Many free Internet advocates and start-ups feel that Airtel's platform could even "lead to monopolisation by a few and squeeze out the small companies". Airtel itself has defended its move saying the initiative would be a 'win-win' for customers and marketers alike. Coming out in support of initiatives like that of Airtel, e-commerce major Flipkart.com's founder Sachin Bansal, tweeted, "when foreign companies do it in India - innovation. Indians do it - violation".

In a debate moderated by TIMES NOW's Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami, panelists -- Tanmay Bhat, Comedian & Co-Founder, AIB; Roshan Abbas, Writer & Director; Priyanka Chaturvedi, Spokesperson, Congress; Shazia Ilmi, Leader, BJP; Raghav Chadha, Leader, AAP; T V Ramachandran, Chairman, ASSOCHAM Telecom Council and Rajan Matthews, Director General, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) -- discuss the issue -- how can telecom companies decide what you want to access?

Video: id=-ft-bU9tn5ctitle=Net Neutrality: Is the Internet a Public Utility? | Idea Channel | PBS Digital Studiosdescription=The views discussed in this episode do not necessarily reflect the views of PBS or its member stations. All thoughts and opinions presented are the province of Mike Rugnetta.

Is the internet a public utility? No. Should it be? That's an interesting question. The Internet, as we've said many a time, is a glorious series of tubes, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) sell us access to those tubes. But the FCC is considering a new Two Tiered system, in which some companies could pay ISPs for faster delivery. This topic (aka Net Neutrality) has made us think about the important role the internet plays in our lives. Is internet access so important that it should be classified as a public utility or common carrier, like water & electricity, or public buses and subways? Watch the episode and find out!

Video: id=MqnnsFiiIwYtitle=FCC's Ajit Pai: Net Neutrality is a "Solution That Won't Work to a Problem That Doesn't Exist"description=Net Neutrality is "a solution that won't work to a problem that doesn't exist," says Ajit Pai, a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

Pai is an oustpoken opponent of expanding government control of the internet, including FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's plan to regulate Internet Service Providers (ISPs) under the same Title II rules that are used to govern telephone-service providers as public utilities. Under current FCC regulations, ISPs are considered providers of "information services" and subject to essentially no federal regulation.

He is also sharply critical of President Barack Obama's very public push to influence policy at the FCC, which is technically an independent agency. Last year, it was widely believed that Wheeler, a former head of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, would not push for Title II. Pai calls the president's actions—which included "creating a YouTube video of with very specific prescriptions as to what this agency should do"—unprecedented in his experience. Coupled with the fact that "the agency suddenly chang[ed]course from where it was to mimic the president’s plan," says Pai, "suggests that the independence of the agency has been compromised to some extent."

The FCC is scheduled to vote Thursday, February 26 on Wheeler's plan.

Pai explains his opposition to Title II reclassifcation to Reason's Nick Gillespie. Citing independent studies of American competitiveness and booming investment in telecommunications infrastructure compared to Europe, Pai argues that consumers are thriving and the market is doing its job.

Regulating the internet like a utility company, says Pai, will threaten the kind of innovation we've taken for granted over the past 20 years. "Do you trust the federal government to make the Internet ecosystem more vibrant than it is today?" Pai asks. "Can you think of any regulated utility like the electric company or water company that is as innovative as the Internet?"

Runs about 30 minutes.
