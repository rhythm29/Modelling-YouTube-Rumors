Video: id=GuUK1_85U80title=Chandrayaan I: India on the Moondescription=The successful launch of the Chandrayaan-I mission to the moon and the landing of the Moon Impact Probe on the lunar surface on November 14, 2008 was an important milestone for Indian science. The significance of this landmark event was further accentuated when the data from the Probe established the presence of water molecules on the moon. This film documents the epic voyage of Chandrayaan-I, tracing its planning, its objectives and the cost effective manner in which it delivered its payloads to their destinations. The film also brings out the remarkable collaboration between the global scientific community and their Indian counterparts in ensuring that the saga of Chandrayaan-I will be remembered as another long step for mankind.tags=nullpublishedAt=2012-08-06T07:35:49.000Zduration=PT27M29SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=53553likes=174dislikes=13favourite=0comments=44topicIds=[/m/04wv_, /m/03_835, /m/09cws]0

Video: id=Nh6H0GiTgcstitle=India launches first unmanned moon missiondescription=http://www.instablogs.com/ India launches first unmanned moon mission The successful launch of the unmanned moon mission is a giant leap for India. With this latest achievement India stands tall an proud space fraternity dominated by the likes of US, Russia and China. Chandrayaan I demonstrates India's determination to be a big player in the race to find the gas Helium-3, a replacement for fossil fuels. One of the mission's objectives is to understand the mineralogy of the moon in greater detail and work out how much Helium-3 is hidden beneath the craters.Helium-3 is a hundred times more precious than gold and is touted as the future fuel of nuclear plants and vehicles. We hope that by carrying out this mission we will have a greater claim on the fuel of the future when man begins to colonise the satellite. This is just the beginning of India's space ambitions. We hope to put the first Indian into space by 2014 and launch a manned lunar mission by 2020 â four years ahead of rival China. Cheers to ISRO that has done the country proud.tags=nullpublishedAt=2008-10-22T14:58:14.000Zduration=PT1M27SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=2689likes=9dislikes=0favourite=0comments=2topicIds=[/m/04wv_]0

Chandrayaan I (Sanskrit: चंद्रयान-1, lit: Lunar Craft), is an unmanned lunar exploration mission by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The mission includes a lunar orbiter as well as an impactor. The spacecraft will be launched by a modified version of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.. . The remote sensing satellite will weigh 1304 kg (590 kg initial orbit mass and 504 kg dry mass) and carry high resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, soft and hard X-ray frequencies. Over a two-year period, it is intended to survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and 3-dimensional topography. The polar regions are of special interest, as they might contain water ice.. . The mission includes five ISRO payloads. Six other payloads from NASA, ESA, and the Bulgarian Aerospace Agency are getting free ride thanks to the Indian generosity.. . Mission Objectives:. . 1) To launch and orbit a spacecraft in lunar polar orbit and conduct scientific studies.. 2) To carry out high resolution mapping of topographic features in 3D, distribution of various minerals and elemental chemical species including radioactive nuclides covering the entire lunar surface using a set of remote sensing payloads. The new set of data would help in unraveling mysteries about the origin and evolution of solar system in general and that of the moon in particular or on its composition and mineralogy.. 3) Realize the mission goal of harnessing the science payloads, lunar craft and the launch vehicle with suitable ground support system including DSN station, integration and testing, launching and achieving lunar orbit of ~100 km, in-orbit operation of experiments, communication/telecommand, telemetry data reception, quick look data and archival for scientific utilization by identified group of scientists.tags=nullpublishedAt=2008-10-17T20:02:57.000Zduration=PT4M54SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=37173likes=53dislikes=6favourite=0comments=48topicIds=[/m/03_835, /m/04wv_]0

Video: id=ehyHRjR5844title=India Moon Mission Chandrayaan - 1 ISRO official Documentary 1/3description=Chandrayaan-1 (Sanskrit: चंद्रयान-१, lit: moon-traveller, or moon vehicle  pronunciation (help·info)) was India's first unmanned lunar probe. It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation in October 2008, and operated until August 2009. The mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor. India launched the spacecraft by a modified version of the PSLV, PSLV C11 on 22 October 2008 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Nellore District, Andhra Pradesh, about 80 km north of Chennai, at 06:22 IST (00:52 UTC). The mission was a major boost to India's space program, as India researched and developed its own technology in order to explore the Moon. The vehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.. . On 14 November 2008, the Moon Impact Probe separated from the Chandrayaan orbiter at 20:06 and struck the south pole in a controlled manner, making India the fourth country to place its flag on the Moon. The probe impacted near Shackleton Crater at 20:31 ejecting underground soil that could be analysed for the presence of lunar water ice.. The estimated cost for the project was Rs. 386 crore (US$ 90 million).. . The remote sensing lunar satellite had a mass of 1,380 kilograms (3,042 lb) at launch and 675 kilograms (1,488 lb) in lunar orbit. It carried high resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, and soft and hard X-ray frequencies. Over a two-year period, it was intended to survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and three-dimensional topography. The polar regions are of special interest as they might contain ice.. . The lunar mission carries five ISRO payloads and six payloads from other space agencies including NASA, ESA, and the Bulgarian Aerospace Agency, which were carried free of cost.. . After suffering from several technical issues including failure of the star sensors and poor thermal shielding, Chandrayaan stopped sending radio signals at 1:30 AM IST on 29 August 2009 shortly after which, the ISRO officially declared the mission over. Chandrayaan operated for 312 days as opposed to the intended two years but the mission achieved 95 percent of its planned objectives. Among its many achievements was the discovery of the widespread presence of water molecules in lunar soiltags=nullpublishedAt=2010-05-09T04:42:59.000Zduration=PT10M1SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=18530likes=42dislikes=1favourite=0comments=15topicIds=[/m/04wv_, /m/03_835, /m/03zwkz]0

It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation in October 2008, and operated until August 2009. The mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor. India launched the spacecraft by a modified version of the PSLV, PSLV C11 on 22 October 2008 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Nellore District, Andhra Pradesh, about 80 km north of Chennai, at 06:22 IST (00:52 UTC). The mission was a major boost to India's space program, as India researched and developed its own technology in order to explore the Moon. The vehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.. . On 14 November 2008, the Moon Impact Probe separated from the Chandrayaan orbiter at 20:06 and struck the south pole in a controlled manner, making India the fourth country to place its flag on the Moon. The probe impacted near Shackleton Crater at 20:31 ejecting underground soil that could be analysed for the presence of lunar water ice.. The estimated cost for the project was Rs. 386 crore (US$ 90 million).. . The remote sensing lunar satellite had a mass of 1,380 kilograms (3,042 lb) at launch and 675 kilograms (1,488 lb) in lunar orbit. It carried high resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, and soft and hard X-ray frequencies. Over a two-year period, it was intended to survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and three-dimensional topography. The polar regions are of special interest as they might contain ice.. . The lunar mission carries five ISRO payloads and six payloads from other space agencies including NASA, ESA, and the Bulgarian Aerospace Agency, which were carried free of cost.. . After suffering from several technical issues including failure of the star sensors and poor thermal shielding, Chandrayaan stopped sending radio signals at 1:30 AM IST on 29 August 2009 shortly after which, the ISRO officially declared the mission over. Chandrayaan operated for 312 days as opposed to the intended two years but the mission achieved 95 percent of its planned objectives.

Video: id=Nrbm7oeVEyctitle=Chandrayaan-1, India's first mission to Moon (Part 3/3)description=Courtesy ISRO: "THE MOON" with the history of the early solar system etched on it beckons mankind from time immemorial to admire its marvels and discover its secrets. Understanding the moon provides a pathway to unravel the early evolution of the solar system and that of the planet earth. .   .   Through the ages, the Moon, our closest celestial body has aroused curiosity in our mind much more than any other objects in the sky.  .  . Scientific Objectives:.  . - The Chandrayaan-1 mission is aimed at high-resolution remote sensing of the moon in visible, near infrared(NIR), low energy X-rays and high-energy X-ray regions. Specifically the objectives will be  .  . - To prepare a three-dimensional atlas (with a high spatial and altitude resolution of 5-10m) of both near and far side of the moon. .   . - To conduct chemical and mineralogical mapping of the entire lunar surface for distribution of elements such as Magnesium, Aluminum, Silicon, Calcium, Iron and Titanium with a spatial resolution of about 25 km and high atomic number elements such as Radon, Uranium & Thorium with a spatial resolution of about 20 km. . . - Simultaneous photo geological and chemical mapping will enable identification of different geological units, which will test the early evolutionary history of the moon and help in determining the nature and stratigraphy of the lunar crust. .  .   . Mission Objectives:.  . - To realise the mission goal of harnessing the science payloads, lunar craft and the launch vehicle with suitable ground support systems including DSN station. .   . - To realise the integration and testing, launching and achieving lunar polar orbit of about 100 km, in-orbit operation of experiments, communication/ telecommand, telemetry data reception, quick look data and archival for scientific utilization by identified group of scientists.. . GROUND SEGMENT FOR CHANDRAYAAN-1 MISSION, comprises of three major elements: . . The Ground Station Network including the Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN), Mission Operations Complex (MOX)and Indian Space Science Data Centre (ISSDC). This trio of ground facility ensures the success of the mission by providing to and fro conduit of communication, securing good health of the spacecraft, maintaining the orbit and attitude to the requirements of the mission and conducting payload operations. The ground segment is also responsible for making the science data available for the Payload Scientists along with auxiliary information, in addition to archiving of payload and spacecraft data. Payload Operation Centres (POCs) also form a part of the Ground Segment.tags=nullpublishedAt=2008-10-28T01:49:53.000Zduration=PT8M34SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=10658likes=14dislikes=3favourite=0comments=13topicIds=[/m/04wv_, /m/03_835]0

Video: id=y6aRFY4zaVAtitle=India's Moon Missiondescription=Now its India turn to join the elite club.. . *The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) announced that the first lunar probe, Chandrayaan-1, from India landed successfully on the moon on Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's birthday. The Indian flag was painted on the sides of Moon Impact Probe (MIP), one of the 11 payloads of Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, that successfully hit the lunar surface on November 14th, at 20:31 hrs (8:31 pm) IST. This is the first Indian built object to reach the surface of the moon. The point of MIP's impact was near the Moon's South Polar Region. It may be recalled that the modern Indian space program was initiated in 1962 when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister of India. The two-year mission is aimed to map not only the surface of the moon, but what lies beneath. The unmanned moon mission was launched Oct. 22 from the Sriharikota space center in southern India. The box-shaped probe carried a video imaging system, a radar altimeter and a mass spectrometer. ISRO spokesman B.R. Guruprasad said that the probe from the orbiting mother spacecraft took pictures and gathered other data India needs for a future moon landing as it plummeted to a crash-landing at the moon's south pole.. . ニュースアニメ「インド初の無人月探査機、月面着陸に成功」. インド初の無人月探査機「チャンドラヤーン１号」が、月面着陸に成功したと、インド宇宙研究機関（ISRO）が発表した。「チャンドラヤーン」はサンスクリット語で「月の乗り物」の意。１０月２２日にインド南部スリハリコタの宇宙センターから打ち上げられ、ネルー初代インド首相の誕生日でもある１１月１４日に月面に着陸した。元首相は１９６２年に近代インドの宇宙計画を打ち出しており、ISROは歴史的な日になったと述べている。月探査を成功させた国は、現在まで旧ソ連、米、日、欧（ESA）、中となるが、今回の打ち上げはこれに次ぐものとなる。今後２年間をかけ、月面の様子を詳しく調べるほか、水や氷の存在についても調査する。今回の打ち上げにかかった費用は３８億６千万ルピー。tags=nullpublishedAt=2008-11-21T11:01:28.000Zduration=PT8SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=9415likes=27dislikes=6favourite=0comments=14topicIds=[/m/04wv_, /m/03_835]0

After all the hoopla and announcements that came from a British firm Inmarsat - a UK satellite firm just days ago, the search has shifted again  by more than  1,100km to the north-east. Five planes spot unidentified objects in a new area of the Indian Ocean being searched for flight MH370 - objects are not debris, not until connected to the flight.  More likely it is ocean garbage.  Without a question this will go down in history as the worst aviation incident cover up - but who is behind it, who is being protected and why?

Video: id=pn6eehNVvXEtitle=Several ground witnesses claim they saw Malaysia Airlines Flight 370description=In the middle of the night, two fishermen near the Malaysia-Thailand border saw a plane flying low over the South China Sea -- at the same time that air traffic controllers lost contact with Flight 370 over the same body of water, at 1:30 a.m. or almost 50 minutes after takeoff. Fisherman Azid Ibrahim and a friend had taken people fishing that night off the coast of Kota Bharu. "I was fishing when I saw the plane -- it looked strange. Flying low. I told my friend that's not normal. Normally, it flies at 35,000 feet. But that night it touched the clouds. I thought the pilot must be crazy," Ibrahim said. "It was really low. I saw the lights they looked like the size of a coconut," he said. Their fishing grounds lay under a flight path, but the predawn plane was unusual to see because of its low altitude, they said. The fishermen filed a police report about their sighting, but Malaysian officials haven't commented.  missing flight 370, Malaysia Airlines (Airline), missing plane, malaysia airlines transponder, malaysia airlines hijack, malaysia airlines theory, malaysia airlines coverage, malaysia airlines flight mh370, missing plane Several ground witnesses claim they saw Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Malaysia Airlines, Boeing 777, 239 Onboard, breaking, new, news, Dahboo77, 2014, False, flag, attack, weather, earthquake, wow, wtf, crazy, look, must, see, conspiracy, truth, government, Obama, Dahbootags=nullpublishedAt=2014-03-20T01:50:16.000Zduration=PT2M11SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=1988likes=10dislikes=0favourite=0comments=5topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]0

Video: id=szdW22mqNBQtitle=Flight 370: The Missing Links  (1080p HD)description=Discovery Channel presents a special one-hour documentary - FLIGHT 370: THE MISSING LINKS - which gathers the foremost thinkers in aviation and security to explore key questions surrounding the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. FLIGHT 370: THE MISSING LINKS will air in more than 220 countries and territories worldwide on Discovery Channel. In Southeast Asia, FLIGHT 370: THE MISSING LINKS will first air exclusively on Discovery Channel.  The mystery of flight MH370 has garnered worldwide attention and generated widespread speculation about how the events unfolded. FLIGHT 370: THE MISSING LINKS looks to industry experts to account for just how it is possible to lose track of an airliner -- analysing evidence, deliberating the global frailties of aviation and divulging potential solutions to prevent the disappearance of an aircraft from ever happening again.  In an age when we can use apps to locate handheld devices, the special also looks at how a state-of-the-art airliner and its 239 passengers and crew can simply vanish. Since flight MH370 went off the grid on 8March 2014, questions about flight safety have once again taken centre stage. In an attempt to answer some of these questions, FLIGHT 370: THE MISSING LINKS addresses seven missing links: airport security, air traffic control, on-board communication systems, mechanical failure, tracking (both radar and satellite), international cooperation, and the black box.tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-04-20T18:13:37.000Zduration=PT43M40SisLiscensed=falsedefination=hdviews=178914likes=323dislikes=33favourite=0comments=161topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]0

Video: id=6vvoRrafamgtitle=Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 'The Plane That Vanished'description=What really happened to MH370?  Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370/MAS370) was a scheduled international passenger flight that disappeared on 8 March 2014, while flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing Capital International Airport in Beijing, China. Flight 370 last made voice contact with air traffic control at 01:19 MYT (17:19 UTC, 7 March) when it was over the South China Sea, less than an hour after takeoff. The aircraft disappeared from air traffic controllers' radar screens at 01:21. Malaysian military radar continued to track Flight 370 as it deviated from its planned flight path and crossed the Malay Peninsula. Flight 370 left the range of Malaysian military radar at 02:22 while over the Andaman Sea, 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) northwest of Penang in northwestern Malaysia. The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was carrying 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 15 nations.  A multinational search effort began in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea, where the flight's signal was lost on secondary surveillance radar, and was soon extended to the Strait of Malacca and Andaman Sea. Analysis of satellite communications between the aircraft and Inmarsat's satellite communications network concluded that the flight continued until at least 08:19 MYT and flew south into the southern Indian Ocean, although the precise location cannot be determined;Australia took charge of the search effort on 17 March, when the search shifted to the southern Indian Ocean. On 24 March 2014, the Malaysian government, noting that the final location determined by the satellite communication is far from any possible landing sites, concluded that "flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean." The current phase of the search is a comprehensive search of the seafloor about 1,800 kilometres (1,100 mi) southwest of Perth, Australia, which began in October 2014. Despite being the largest and most expensive search in aviation history, there has been no confirmation of any flight debris, resulting in speculations about its disappearance.  Malaysia established the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to investigate the incident, working with foreign aviation authorities and experts. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished. Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were initially suspect in the disappearance, but they were later determined to be asylum seekers and terrorism has been ruled out. Malaysian police have identified the Captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all other passengers of any suspicious motives. Power was lost to the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat's satellite communication network at 02:25—three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar. Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of Sumatra and flew for five hours without communication and with little deviation in its track, suggesting that the aircraft was flying on autopilot without manual input from the cockpit and that Flight 370 may have experienced a hypoxia event, ending when fuel was exhausted.  At the time of its disappearance, and if the presumed loss of all on board is confirmed, Flight 370 was the deadliest aviation incident in Malaysia Airlines' history and the deadliest involving a Boeing 777. It was surpassed in both regards 131 days later by the crash of another Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 – Flight 17 – that was shot down over Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines was struggling financially, a problem which was exacerbated by a decline in ticket sales after Flight 370 disappeared and before the crash of Flight 17; the airline was renationalised by the end of 2014. The Malaysian government received significant criticism, especially from China, for failing to disclose information in a timely manner during the early weeks of the search. Flight 370's disappearance brought to the public's attention the limits of aircraft tracking and flight recorders, including several issues raised four years earlier - but never mandated - following the loss of Air France Flight 447. A task force set up by the International Air Transport Association, with the support of the International Civil Aviation Organization, proposed a new standard that, by December 2015, commercial aircraft report their positions every 15 minutes. The Malaysian Ministry of Transport issued an interim report on 8 March 2015.tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-05T23:01:56.000Zduration=PT50M25SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=3088likes=37dislikes=2favourite=0comments=10topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/05czz6l, /m/0bqkj3, /m/015xf8, /m/013_0l]0

Shouldn't we, as users, be allowed to go online to whatever site we want to? In other words, should there be net neutrality? It's a raging debate after Flipkart, one of India's most iconic startups, finds itself in the midst of a controversy over whether its agreement with Airtel Zero violates the principle of net neutrality. Under the agreement, Airtel users would incur no charges for using the Flipkart app with the company reimbursing Airtel directly for this. Critics argue that this alters the nature of the Internet as a leveler where big players like Flipkart and smaller companies have equal access to consumers.

Net Neutrality is extremely important to promote technological innovation, boost economic progress, and to ensure that we don't lose a medium of free speech and thought.  The Indian telecom regulator (TRAI) has proposed 20 questions for your views on two basic topics: a. Should there be licensing of Internet services, and b.

Video: id=5f3cChVh3UMtitle=WE WON! Net Neutrality and Re-Thinking Cynicismdescription=Winning in politics is often bizarre, drawn out, incremental, and ultimately a surprise. As such, winning often doesn't feel that good. But I think it's very important to take a bit of time when it happens to enjoy it.  And also to recognize that the win would not have happened without the people who worked hard to lobby and bug their congresspeople and force a decision down the throat of a bunch of unhappy corporations. So thank you so much to everyone who campaigned to keep the internet neutral.

Video: id=4WLzYQvMv5gtitle=Hitler reacts to Net Neutrality violation in India #netneutralityindiadescription=(post by /u/shrik450 on reddit: http://redd.it/30lz1p)  If you haven't heard yet, the TRAI wants to allow telecos to regulate OTT services such as WhatsApp, Skype or Viber. While this does not directly imply that shit has hit the fan, it could allow Telecos to charge you seperately for each WhatsApp message, or make you pay equivalent charges for Skype calls etc.  Why should I take your word for this?  Here are some news and editorial articles on this:  medianama: http://www.medianama.com/2015/03/223-should-india-have-licensing-of-internet-services-net-neutrality-trai-wants-your-views/  Indian Express: http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/trai-seeks-to-regulate-ott-players-like-skype-viber-whatsapp-and-google-talk/  Wait, you lied to me! The TRAI wants my opinion on this!  Okay, So what should I do?  As you've read (and I hope you've read that), the TRAI wants your opinion on this. Shit hasn't hit the fan yet, and we can turn this around before this actually becomes a serious consideration. So, the first thing you can do is to e-mail the TRAI on their comments email, which is : advqos@trai.gov.in You probably shouldn't copypasta someone else's email on this as it will lead to them beleiving that a few people are spamming their inbox. Some tooltips on what to write would be:  Some tooltips on what to write would be:  - Refer to the recent Net Neutrality agitation, and the subsequent FCC ruling, - Talk about how loss of revenue to Telecos should not be the bar to progress, - Talk about how Net Neutrality laws have already been enacted in The Netherlands after a similar agitation there, - If you want to, talk about how rulings in favour of allowing said regulation are anti-development, and not what you expect from the Government.  What else can I do?  You can tweet the issue out and raise publicity. Since this ruling affects widely used services such as WhatsApp and Skype, more people should be willing to listen.  Dude all this takes too long.  Well, yeah, you can either take 5 minutes now or bitch endlessly later. It's your choice.

Video: id=-ErsLyxYm4otitle=Net Neutrality Wins Big & Why You Should Celebratedescription="Internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile must now act in the "public interest" when providing a mobile connection to your home or phone, under rules approved Thursday by a divided Federal Communications Commission.  The plan, which puts the Internet in the same regulatory camp as the telephone and bans business practices that are "unjust or unreasonable," represents the biggest regulatory shakeup to the industry in almost two decades. The goal is to prevent providers from slowing or blocking web traffic, or creating paid “fast lanes” on the Internet, said FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler.  The 3-2 vote was expected to trigger industry lawsuits that could take several years to resolve. Still, consumer advocates cheered the regulations as a victory for smaller Internet-based companies, who had feared they would have to pay "tolls" to move their content."* The Young Turks hosts Cenk Uygur & John Iadarola break it down.  *Read more here: http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/2/26/fcc-allows-city-owned-internet-providers-to-expand1.html  **********  ISIS, Police Shooting, O'Reilly, Net Neutrality & CPAC - The Young Turks 2/26/2015 News & Politics http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTpcK80irdQgKQyPbycR1j-7Cvrc4k1U4  **********  Buy MAD AS HELL on iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/mad-as-hell/id959174781 Also on other digital platforms, DVD, & Blu-ray at: http://www.MadAsHellFilm.com  **********  Support TYT while shopping on Amazon through this link (bookmark it!) http://www.amazon.com/?tag=theyoungturks-20  The Largest Online News Show in the World.

Video: id=7YcwfZEurU0title=Obama Proposes Surprisingly Strong Net Neutrality Lawsdescription="U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday said Internet service providers should be regulated more like public utilities to make sure they grant equal access to all content providers, touching off intense protests from cable and telecoms companies and Republican lawmakers.  Obama's detailed statement on the issue of "net neutrality," a platform in his 2008 presidential campaign, was a rare intervention by the White House into the policy setting of an independent agency.  Shares of major Internet service providers Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable Inc (TWC.N) fell sharply after Obama said ISPs should be reclassified to face stricter regulations and banned from striking paid "fast lane" deals with content companies."* The Young Turks host Cenk Uygur breaks it down.  *Read more here: http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/10/us-usa-internet-neutrality-idUSKCN0IU1I620141110  **********  Pastor, Obama, George W.

All India Bakchod is back, but with a rather important message: We need to help keep the internet a free space for all of us.  Yes, they’re here to talk about Net Neutrality, and just how much of a concern it should be for the public. If you’re even a little bit confused about what net neutrality is, and why you should care about it, this video will clear things up for you. With their analogies that are absolutely spot-on, you’ll understand why you need to fight telecom operators who are going to make you pay for the websites you use by controlling the speed of your internet connection or providing paid partner services free of cost.  We need to fight this. Because the internet is a free space, and no one should be allowed to make a business out of it.  www.savetheinternet.intags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-12T11:55:22.000Zduration=PT9M8SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=14875likes=339dislikes=5favourite=0comments=11topicIds=[/m/04zdxn]0

Video: id=6IAqN3_waBAtitle=Tanmay Bhat of 'AIB' on Net Neutrality Debate - The Newshour Debate: Fight for free internetdescription=Amid a raging debate over equal Internet access for all, the Government on Monday (April 13) threw its weight behind "non-discriminatory internet access" and said an expert panel is looking into the 'net neutrality' issue. Anti-trust watchdog CCI might also launch a probe into schemes launched by some telecom operators, including Airtel, Reliance Communications and Uninor, that claim to provide 'free' access to certain internet applications, even as the companies defended their stand saying these initiatives did not go against 'net neutrality'. Social media platforms like Twitter continued to remain abuzz, as politicians, filmstars, start-ups and corporates joined the debate, while Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also said there needs to be a debate on the issue. Net neutrality implies equal treatment to all Internet traffic and any priority given to an application or company on payment basis is seen as violating the concept. Telecom regulator TRAI, which last month floated a discussion paper on this, is also looking into the issue. "Non discriminatory net availability is what we need to strive for," Telecom and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, while adding that an expert committee was looking into the matter and should submit its report within a month to help the government make an informed decision.  According to the Minister, Internet is one of the finest creations of the human mind and it is a property of the entire human race and not of any country or society. "Internet to become entirely global should have a link to local and when we talk of digital inclusion it must be available to the underprivileged and on the margins," he said. Sparking off the debate, telecom major Bharti Airtel launched its 'Airtel Zero' marketing platform -- where certain apps are available for free with charges borne by app makers. Many free Internet advocates and start-ups feel that Airtel's platform could even "lead to monopolisation by a few and squeeze out the small companies". Airtel itself has defended its move saying the initiative would be a 'win-win' for customers and marketers alike. Coming out in support of initiatives like that of Airtel, e-commerce major Flipkart.com's founder Sachin Bansal, tweeted, "when foreign companies do it in India - innovation. Indians do it - violation".  In a debate moderated by TIMES NOW's Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami, panelists -- Tanmay Bhat, Comedian & Co-Founder, AIB; Roshan Abbas, Writer & Director; Priyanka Chaturvedi, Spokesperson, Congress; Shazia Ilmi, Leader, BJP; Raghav Chadha, Leader, AAP; T V Ramachandran, Chairman, ASSOCHAM Telecom Council and Rajan Matthews, Director General, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) -- discuss the issue -- how can telecom companies decide what you want to access?

Video: id=-ft-bU9tn5ctitle=Net Neutrality: Is the Internet a Public Utility? | Idea Channel | PBS Digital Studiosdescription=The views discussed in this episode do not necessarily reflect the views of PBS or its member stations. All thoughts and opinions presented are the province of Mike Rugnetta.  Is the internet a public utility? No. Should it be? That's an interesting question. The Internet, as we've said many a time, is a glorious series of tubes, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) sell us access to those tubes. But the FCC is considering a new Two Tiered system, in which some companies could pay ISPs for faster delivery. This topic (aka Net Neutrality) has made us think about the important role the internet plays in our lives. Is internet access so important that it should be classified as a public utility or common carrier, like water & electricity, or public buses and subways? Watch the episode and find out!

Video: id=MqnnsFiiIwYtitle=FCC's Ajit Pai: Net Neutrality is a "Solution That Won't Work to a Problem That Doesn't Exist"description=Net Neutrality is "a solution that won't work to a problem that doesn't exist," says Ajit Pai, a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  Pai is an oustpoken opponent of expanding government control of the internet, including FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's plan to regulate Internet Service Providers (ISPs) under the same Title II rules that are used to govern telephone-service providers as public utilities. Under current FCC regulations, ISPs are considered providers of "information services" and subject to essentially no federal regulation.  He is also sharply critical of President Barack Obama's very public push to influence policy at the FCC, which is technically an independent agency. Last year, it was widely believed that Wheeler, a former head of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, would not push for Title II. Pai calls the president's actions—which included "creating a YouTube video of with very specific prescriptions as to what this agency should do"—unprecedented in his experience. Coupled with the fact that "the agency suddenly chang[ed]course from where it was to mimic the president’s plan," says Pai, "suggests that the independence of the agency has been compromised to some extent."  The FCC is scheduled to vote Thursday, February 26 on Wheeler's plan.  Pai explains his opposition to Title II reclassifcation to Reason's Nick Gillespie. Citing independent studies of American competitiveness and booming investment in telecommunications infrastructure compared to Europe, Pai argues that consumers are thriving and the market is doing its job.  Regulating the internet like a utility company, says Pai, will threaten the kind of innovation we've taken for granted over the past 20 years. "Do you trust the federal government to make the Internet ecosystem more vibrant than it is today?" Pai asks. "Can you think of any regulated utility like the electric company or water company that is as innovative as the Internet?"  Runs about 30 minutes.  Produced by Todd Krainin.

Video: id=RhifPGRnXIAtitle=11-Year-Old Muslim Girl's Valentine To Obama- "We Are Good People"description=“'Please tell everyone that we are good people & we are just like everyone else'" —Obama reading a Valentine from Sabrina, 11, who is Muslim  Transcript: I’m thinking of a little girl named Sabrina who last month sent me a Valentine’s Day card in the shape of a heart.  It was the first Valentine I got.  (Laughter.)  I got it from Sabrina before Malia and Sasha and Michelle gave me one.  (Laughter.)  So she’s 11 years old.  She’s in the 5th grade.  She’s a young Muslim American.  And she said in her Valentine, “I enjoy being an American.”  And when she grows up, she wants to be an engineer -- or a basketball player.  (Laughter.)  Which are good choices. (Laughter.)  But she wrote, “I am worried about people hating Muslims…If some Muslims do bad things, that doesn’t mean all of them do.”  And she asked, “Please tell everyone that we are good people and we’re just like everyone else.”  (Applause.)  Now, those are the words -- and the wisdom -- of a little girl growing up here in America, just like my daughters are growing up here in America.  “We’re just like everybody else.”  And everybody needs to remember that during the course of this debate.  As we move forward with these challenges, we all have responsibilities, we all have hard work ahead of us on this issue.  We can’t paper over problems, and we’re not going to solve this if we’re always just trying to be politically correct. But we do have to remember that 11-year-old girl.  That’s our hope.  That’s our future.  That’s how we discredit violent ideologies, by making sure her voice is lifted up; making sure she’s nurtured; making sure that she’s supported -- and then, recognizing there are little girls and boys like that all around the world, and us helping to address economic and political grievances that can be exploited by extremists, and empowering local communities, and us staying true to our values as a diverse and tolerant society even when we’re threatened -- especially when we’re threatened.  There will be a military component to this.  There are savage cruelties going on out there that have to be stopped.  ISIL is killing Muslims at a rate that is many multiples the rate that they’re killing non-Muslims.  Everybody has a stake in stopping them, and there will be an element of us just stopping them in their tracks with force.  But to eliminate the soil out of which they grew, to make sure that we are giving a brighter future to everyone and a lasting sense of security, then we're going to have to make it clear to all of our children -- including that little girl in 5th grade -- that you have a place. You have a place here in America.  You have a place in those countries where you live.  You have a future.  Ultimately, those are the antidotes to violent extremism.  And that's work that we're going to have to do together.  It will take time.  This is a generational challenge.  But after 238 years, it should be obvious -- America has overcome much bigger challenges, and we’ll overcome the ones that we face today.  We will stay united and committed to the ideals that have shaped us for more than two centuries, including the opportunity and justice and dignity of every single human being.  Thank you very much, everybody.

Malik Obama's oversight of the Muslim Brotherhood's international investments is one reason for the Obama administration's support of the Muslim Brotherhood, according to an Egyptian report citing the vice president of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, Tehani al-Gebali Ads by Google  President Obama PollIs Barack Obama Doing a Good Job? National Poll Wants Your Opinion. SpringboardAmerica.com/NationalPoll Will You Boldly Proclaim"I am a Christian"? Sign the pledge now! billygraham.org/I-am-a-Christian  In a news report on Egyptian television of a Gebali speech, translated by researcher Walid Shoebat, a former Palestinian Liberation Organization operative, Gebali said she would like "to inform the American people that their president's brother Obama is one of the architects of the major investments of the Muslim Brotherhood."  "We will carry out the law, and the Americans will not stop us," she said. "We need to open the files and begin court sessions.  "The Obama administration cannot stop us; they know that they supported terrorism," she continued. "We will open the files so these nations are exposed, to show how they collaborated with [the terrorists]. It is for this reason that the American administration fights us."  http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/obamas-brother-linked-to-muslim-brotherhood/  Stay in the know - Follow Alex on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RealAlexJones 'Like' Alex on FACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/AlexanderEme... http://www.infowars.com/ http://www.prisonplanet.com/ http://www.infowars.net/ http://www.prisonplanet.tv [[START GETTING HEALTHY NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE]] **Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0 is the most advanced multi-vitamin mineral complex to date. http://infowarshealth.com/ [[INFOWARS THE MAGAZINE - AUGUST ISSUE]] http://www.infowarsshop.com/-Infowars...

With this latest achievement India stands tall an proud space fraternity dominated by the likes of US, Russia and China. Chandrayaan I demonstrates India's determination to be a big player in the race to find the gas Helium-3, a replacement for fossil fuels. One of the mission's objectives is to understand the mineralogy of the moon in greater detail and work out how much Helium-3 is hidden beneath the craters.Helium-3 is a hundred times more precious than gold and is touted as the future fuel of nuclear plants and vehicles. We hope that by carrying out this mission we will have a greater claim on the fuel of the future when man begins to colonise the satellite. This is just the beginning of India's space ambitions. We hope to put the first Indian into space by 2014 and launch a manned lunar mission by 2020 â four years ahead of rival China. Cheers to ISRO that has done the country proud.tags=nullpublishedAt=2008-10-22T14:58:14.000Zduration=PT1M27SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=2689likes=9dislikes=0favourite=0comments=2topicIds=[/m/04wv_]  Video: id=043KLT0zoHYtitle=Chandrayaan-I - India's Lunar Missiondescription=A voyage to moon. Chandrayaan-I.. . Chandrayaan I (Sanskrit: चंद्रयान-1, lit: Lunar Craft), is an unmanned lunar exploration mission by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The mission includes a lunar orbiter as well as an impactor. The spacecraft will be launched by a modified version of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.. . The remote sensing satellite will weigh 1304 kg (590 kg initial orbit mass and 504 kg dry mass) and carry high resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, soft and hard X-ray frequencies. Over a two-year period, it is intended to survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and 3-dimensional topography. The polar regions are of special interest, as they might contain water ice.. . The mission includes five ISRO payloads. Six other payloads from NASA, ESA, and the Bulgarian Aerospace Agency are getting free ride thanks to the Indian generosity.. . Mission Objectives:. . 1) To launch and orbit a spacecraft in lunar polar orbit and conduct scientific studies.. 2) To carry out high resolution mapping of topographic features in 3D, distribution of various minerals and elemental chemical species including radioactive nuclides covering the entire lunar surface using a set of remote sensing payloads. The new set of data would help in unraveling mysteries about the origin and evolution of solar system in general and that of the moon in particular or on its composition and mineralogy.. 3) Realize the mission goal of harnessing the science payloads, lunar craft and the launch vehicle with suitable ground support system including DSN station, integration and testing, launching and achieving lunar orbit of ~100 km, in-orbit operation of experiments, communication/telecommand, telemetry data reception, quick look data and archival for scientific utilization by identified group of scientists.tags=nullpublishedAt=2008-10-17T20:02:57.000Zduration=PT4M54SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=37173likes=53dislikes=6favourite=0comments=48topicIds=[/m/03_835, /m/04wv_]  Video: id=AvQDwt7wO7gtitle=India launches first moon missiondescription=India has successfully launched its first lunar mission, marking a major boost for the country's space programme and a new step in the fast-developing Asian space race.tags=nullpublishedAt=2008-10-23T21:24:43.000Zduration=PT1M23SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=1367likes=3dislikes=0favourite=0comments=0topicIds=[/m/04wv_]  Video: id=S1dcmr-Eyswtitle=Chandrayaan : India's Moon Mission ---part 2description=Part 2 of the Moon Mission Documentary.

It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation in October 2008, and operated until August 2009. The mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor. India launched the spacecraft by a modified version of the PSLV, PSLV C11 on 22 October 2008 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Nellore District, Andhra Pradesh, about 80 km north of Chennai, at 06:22 IST (00:52 UTC). The mission was a major boost to India's space program, as India researched and developed its own technology in order to explore the Moon. The vehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.. . On 14 November 2008, the Moon Impact Probe separated from the Chandrayaan orbiter at 20:06 and struck the south pole in a controlled manner, making India the fourth country to place its flag on the Moon. The probe impacted near Shackleton Crater at 20:31 ejecting underground soil that could be analysed for the presence of lunar water ice.. The estimated cost for the project was Rs. 386 crore (US$ 90 million).. . The remote sensing lunar satellite had a mass of 1,380 kilograms (3,042 lb) at launch and 675 kilograms (1,488 lb) in lunar orbit. It carried high resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, and soft and hard X-ray frequencies. Over a two-year period, it was intended to survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and three-dimensional topography. The polar regions are of special interest as they might contain ice.. . The lunar mission carries five ISRO payloads and six payloads from other space agencies including NASA, ESA, and the Bulgarian Aerospace Agency, which were carried free of cost.. .

It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation in October 2008, and operated until August 2009. The mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor. India launched the spacecraft by a modified version of the PSLV, PSLV C11 on 22 October 2008 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Nellore District, Andhra Pradesh, about 80 km north of Chennai, at 06:22 IST (00:52 UTC). The mission was a major boost to India's space program, as India researched and developed its own technology in order to explore the Moon. The vehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.. . On 14 November 2008, the Moon Impact Probe separated from the Chandrayaan orbiter at 20:06 and struck the south pole in a controlled manner, making India the fourth country to place its flag on the Moon. The probe impacted near Shackleton Crater at 20:31 ejecting underground soil that could be analysed for the presence of lunar water ice.. The estimated cost for the project was Rs. 386 crore (US$ 90 million).. . The remote sensing lunar satellite had a mass of 1,380 kilograms (3,042 lb) at launch and 675 kilograms (1,488 lb) in lunar orbit. It carried high resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, and soft and hard X-ray frequencies. Over a two-year period, it was intended to survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and three-dimensional topography.

The Indian flag was painted on the sides of Moon Impact Probe (MIP), one of the 11 payloads of Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, that successfully hit the lunar surface on November 14th, at 20:31 hrs (8:31 pm) IST. This is the first Indian built object to reach the surface of the moon. The point of MIP's impact was near the Moon's South Polar Region. It may be recalled that the modern Indian space program was initiated in 1962 when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister of India. The two-year mission is aimed to map not only the surface of the moon, but what lies beneath. The unmanned moon mission was launched Oct. 22 from the Sriharikota space center in southern India. The box-shaped probe carried a video imaging system, a radar altimeter and a mass spectrometer. ISRO spokesman B.R. Guruprasad said that the probe from the orbiting mother spacecraft took pictures and gathered other data India needs for a future moon landing as it plummeted to a crash-landing at the moon's south pole.. . ニュースアニメ「インド初の無人月探査機、月面着陸に成功」. インド初の無人月探査機「チャンドラヤーン１号」が、月面着陸に成功したと、インド宇宙研究機関（ISRO）が発表した。「チャンドラヤーン」はサンスクリット語で「月の乗り物」の意。１０月２２日にインド南部スリハリコタの宇宙センターから打ち上げられ、ネルー初代インド首相の誕生日でもある１１月１４日に月面に着陸した。元首相は１９６２年に近代インドの宇宙計画を打ち出しており、ISROは歴史的な日になったと述べている。月探査を成功させた国は、現在まで旧ソ連、米、日、欧（ESA）、中となるが、今回の打ち上げはこれに次ぐものとなる。今後２年間をかけ、月面の様子を詳しく調べるほか、水や氷の存在についても調査する。今回の打ち上げにかかった費用は３８億６千万ルピー。tags=nullpublishedAt=2008-11-21T11:01:28.000Zduration=PT8SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=9415likes=27dislikes=6favourite=0comments=14topicIds=[/m/04wv_, /m/03_835]  Video: id=qyy41uEUONgtitle=INDIA TEST NEW SUPER TECHNOLOGY - 2014 - LIKE MOON MISSIONdescription=tags=nullpublishedAt=2012-04-28T17:12:57.000Zduration=PT1M59SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=922likes=5dislikes=3favourite=0comments=3topicIds=[/m/03rk0]  Video: id=aN4FkV6YO1otitle=Chandrayaan : India's Moon Mission ---part 1description=Part 1 of the Moon Mission Documentary.

An apple associate lost the apple iphone 4g prototype at a bar and someone picked it up.. . . What's new. . • Front-facing video chat camera. • Improved regular back-camera (the lens is quite noticeably larger than the iPhone 3GS). • Camera flash. • Micro-SIM instead of standard SIM (like the iPad). • Improved display. It's unclear if it's the 960x640 display thrown around before—it certainly looks like it, with the "Connect to iTunes" screen displaying much higher resolution than on a 3GS.. • What looks to be a secondary mic for noise cancellation, at the top, next to the headphone jack. • Split buttons for volume. • Power, mute, and volume buttons are all metallic. . . . . What's changed. . • The back is entirely flat, made of either glass (more likely) or ceramic or shiny plastic in order for the cell signal to poke through. Tapping on the back makes a more hollow and higher pitched sound compared to tapping on the glass on the front/screen, but that could just be the orientation of components inside making for a different sound. • An aluminum border going completely around the outside. • Slightly smaller screen than the 3GS (but seemingly higher resolution). • Everything is more squared off. • 3 grams heavier. • 16% Larger battery. • Internals components are shrunken, miniaturized and reduced to make room for the larger batterytags=nullpublishedAt=2010-04-22T23:36:34.000Zduration=PT1M4SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=1806likes=3dislikes=0favourite=0comments=2topicIds=[/m/027lnzs, /m/0k8z]1  Video: id=iJWvBCmZPlQtitle=iOS 8.2 Jailbreak & iOS 8.3 Jailbreak Update, iPhone 6c Leaked, iPad Pro Rumors - TaiG Release Date?description=BestTechInfo and Rumors 225: NEW iOS 8.2 Jailbreak and iOS 8.3 Jailbreak TaiG Update, Official announcement, iPhone 6c Leaked and iPad Pro rumors are discussed.

In the first part of this video we're going to talk about what the blogs have been buzzing about, and in the second part, what we would LIKE to see from the next iPhone. All of these rumors are unconfirmed, so take them with a grain of salt.  First of all, most analysts have ruled out the possibility of the iPhone 6 dropping this year, so it's everyone's best guess that the phone coming out will be the iPhone 5S. Most rumors have pointed to a May or June announcement, and a June or July launch of the new phone.  Next up, here's a weird one: a Chinese technology site recently published pictures of what they claim to be new handsets right off of Foxconn's production line.  Based on the images and other reports, analysts have speculated that Apple will be releasing a less expensive version of the iPhone, using a plastic back instead of all metal construction. Which, coming from Apple, would be a highly puzzling move, to say the least.  Those are the two most persistent rumors at the moment so far at least. What we're more interested in is talking about the competitive landscape of smartphones these days. With Samsung Galaxy consistently bringing the heat and the Xperia Z, HTC One, and even Blackberry Z10 drawing a lot of attention, it's clear that Apple is going to have to do SOMETHING interesting in the future. Because consumers have pretty much gone numb to slight megapixel bumps in the camera, faster processors, more ram, and higher res screens by now. Those things are no longer surprises, they're expectations - you're not winning if you do them, but you are losing if you don't.  So we have to ask the question: what new features would Apple have to add to the phone to get you excited about the 5S? NFC support, better speakers, a huge leap in camera quality, 2-day battery life, a life-size cyborg version of Siri with every purchase? Seriously though, let's say you're a proud Galaxy S3 owner, what would Apple have to put in their new handset to make you consider switching? Let us know in the comments, and we'll see you guys next time, on AskMen.tags=nullpublishedAt=2013-03-05T22:44:57.000Zduration=PT1M44SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=10896likes=86dislikes=8favourite=0comments=61topicIds=[/m/027lnzs, /m/0w_ghcf, /m/0gg4gh4]  Video: id=Jn35DkJdSdYtitle=NEW iPhone 6 Leaked Housing - Unboxing, First Look: iPhone 5s vs iPhone 6 Component Reviewdescription=WATCH FIRST  For More Updates, Follow Me On Twitter: http://twitter.com/#!/iCrackUriDevice  iPhone 6 Housing Leaked, Reviewed and Unboxing - iPhone 6 Pre-Release Rear Shell HD comparison and written information can be found here: http://www.besttechinfo.com/apple/iphone-6-leaked-housing-comparison-versus-iphone-5s-besttechinfo-exclusive  Further iPhone 6 leaked images, including close-up shots of the iPhone 6's power and lock button, as well as the redesigned volume rocker and speaker grill available on Evasi0n Jailbreak: http://www.evasi0njailbreak.com/iphone-6-leaked-housing-hd-gallery-evasi0n-jailbreak   Like Me On Facebook: http://bit.ly/iCu-iD-FB   Subscribe if you enjoyed my exclusive iPhone 6 coverage for more great videos and an upcoming Giveaway!tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-07-29T03:33:27.000Zduration=PT5M53SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=1475931likes=3823dislikes=590favourite=0comments=1113topicIds=[/m/011sm55g, /m/027lnzs, /m/0w_ghcf]  Video: id=uAvRkx7G314title=iPhone 6 Leaked a Day Early in Mainland China [English Subtitles]description=The group responsible for the leak is called 就是高科技 [Just High Tech], you can find them on 微博 [Weibo].

NEW DEVELOPMENTSdescription=U.S. intelligence officials are leaning toward the theory that "those in the cockpit" -- the pilots of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 -- were responsible for the mysterious disappearance of the commercial jetliner, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the latest thinking told CNN on Saturday. The revelation followed news that Malaysian authorities searched the home of the lead pilot, a move that came the same day that Prime Minister Najib Razak told reporters the plane veered off course due to apparent deliberate action taken by somebody on board. The Malaysian government had been looking for a reason to search the home of the pilot and the co-pilot for several days. But it was only in the last 24 to 36 hours, when radar and satellite data came to light, that authorities believed they had sufficient reason to go through the residences, according to the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The Malaysians don't do this lightly," the official said. It's not clear whether the Malaysian government believes one or both the men could be responsible for what happened when the Boeing 777-200 ER disappeared March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. What we know about the cockpit crew The official emphasized no final conclusions have been drawn and all the internal intelligence discussions are based on preliminary assessments of what is known to date. Other scenarios could still emerge. The notion of a hijacking has not been ruled out, the official said. A source close to the investigation told CNN that Malaysian police had searched the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53. Shah lives in an upscale gated community in Shah Alam, outside Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur. Two vans were loaded with small bags, similar to shopping bags, at the home of the co-pilot, 27-year-old Farq Ab Hamid, according to a CNN crew who observed activities at the residence. It was unclear whether the bags were taken from the home, and police made no comment about their activities there. Najib made clear in a press conference that in light of the latest developments, authorities have refocused their investigation to the crew and passengers on board. Undoubtedly, they will scour through the flight manifest and look further to see whether any of the passengers on board had flight training or connections to terror groups. A senior U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that investigators are carefully reviewing the information so far collected on the pilots to determine whether there is something to indicate a plan or a motive. That would seem supported by preliminary U.S. intelligence reports, which the U.S. official said show the jetliner was in some form of controlled flight at a relatively stable altitude and path when it changed course and flew toward the Indian Ocean. It is presumed by U.S. officials to have crashed, perhaps after running out of fuel. 'Someone acting deliberately' The first clue that perhaps one or both of the pilots were involved stem from when the plane made a sharp, deliberate turn from where it last communicated with Kuala Lumpur air traffic controllers, and before it would have to communicate with Vietnamese controllers, according to the U.S. official with knowledge of the latest intelligence thinking. "This is the perfect place to start to disappear," the official said. Military radar showed the jetliner flew in a westerly direction back over the Malaysian peninsula, Najib said. It is then believed to have either turned northwest toward the Bay of Bengal or southwest elsewhere in the Indian Ocean, he said. "Evidence is consistent with someone acting deliberately from inside the plane," the Prime Minister said, officially confirming the plane's disappearance was not caused by an accident. "....Despite media reports that the plane was hijacked, we are investigating all major possibilities on what caused MH370 to deviate." The focus of the search is now in the southern Indian Ocean. "The southern scenario seems more plausible," the official said. Meanwhile, according to Najib, new satellite information leads authorities to be fairly certain that someone disabled the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS, just before the aircraft reached the east coast of peninsular Malaysia. "Shortly afterward, near the border between Malaysian and Vietnamese air traffic control," Najib said, "the aircraft's transponder was switched off." ACARS is the system that routinely transmits information like turbulence and fuel load back to the airline. A transponder is a system controlled from the cockpit that transmits data about the plane via radio signals to air traffic controllers. It combines with ground radar to provide air traffic controllers with details about the plane, including its identification, speed, position and altitude.

You need not be afraid of him.  Matthew 7:15 15 "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.  Matthew 15:13-14 13 He answered, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. 14 Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit."  John 8:12 12 Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."  FELLOWSHIP WITH BROTHERS.

The atoll, which takes the form of a ring shaped reef, first came to world attention in 2004 after the Asian tsunami disaster and now has resurfaced thanks to conspiracy theories that have sprung up connecting MH370 to it.  Because of its favourable ocean topography, including a deep underwater trench, the island was shielded from major damage during the 2004 tsunami. While a 1.8m-high wave did hit the island, the underwater canyon essentially bore the brunt of the assault and there was no major impact on the island's facilities or its people.tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-04-05T02:41:16.000Zduration=PT4M59SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=813220likes=980dislikes=341favourite=0comments=590topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l, /m/02ddv]1  Video: id=BRv5BLik1Dwtitle=Important Facts You're Not Being Told About Lost Malaysia Airlines Flight 370!description=Moe info at links:  http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/10/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-knowns-unknowns/  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JpbZZKqxy0  http://www.naturalnews.com/044244_Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370_vanished.html#ixzz2vYJsCwCXtags=nullpublishedAt=2014-03-10T17:56:12.000Zduration=PT9M31SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=510144likes=1724dislikes=382favourite=0comments=361topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]0  Video: id=QKgBkxt508Etitle=Is Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 similar to past mysteries?description=CNN's Martin Savidge examines other airline mysteries that could be similar to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-03-10T23:36:08.000Zduration=PT2M13SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=298296likes=255dislikes=44favourite=0comments=131topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]0  Video: id=B2h5YK-y3kUtitle=MH 370 Secret - The Disappearance Of Malaysia Airlines Flightdescription=This is the inside story of a disaster that seems unimaginable in our time.

How can 239 people and a Boeing 777 disappear into thin air? Most experts believe that the plane somehow suffered a catastrophic mechanical failure, but now the world is speculating possible human involvement. Here are some of the top conspiracy theories and rebuttals currently circulating in social media discussion:  The plane was shot down by the US Navy shortly after it took off.  Impossible since the engines of the plane submit real-time data through a satellite uplink. For this flight, that data was being submitted a full five hours after the takeoff of the jet.  The two Iranians or the flight crew turned off the plane's transponder and flew it to an undisclosed location.  False. The plane would have to fly through the active radar of many countries and it never showed up again on any radar.  The plane flew east and landed at a secret base, perhaps in Vietnam or the Philippines.  False. The Malaysian government tracked the plane going west. In addition, a large airstrip is required to land a 777 and such a strip would easily be seen on satellite pictures.  The plane was struck by a missile and pilots were able to send a distress call before it crashed.  False. This particular airplane is a fly-by-wire which means the pilots have direct control. The plane turned around and flew in an opposite direction than what was programmed into its flight computer. If a missile hit the cockpit of the plane, it could not turn nor could any autopilot be activated. If the pilots were all dead, the plane is programmed to continue flying and land by itself.  Aliens took the plane.  We have no answer for this one, but it is a popular source of discussion.  The plane survived and has landed somewhere and the U.S. government knows exactly where it is.  This would cause a scandal that would bring down the Obama administration and cause untold damage to the United States. Would President Obama authorize something like this which could lead to war?  Mistrust of the government, belief in aliens, or the Illuminati causing the disappearance are all theories constructed in the world of social media. The Malaysian government has officially stated that someone aboard the plane disabled critical systems. The question remains? Was it the flight crew or unknown passengers that committed this crime? In the end, the truth will come out.

Nothing conclusive yet," a senior police official who has direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Sunday night, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak to the press. With news that the Boeing 777-200ER may have flown for more than seven hours after its transponder stopped sending signals March 8, officials said the expanding search area extends over land in southern Asia as far north as Kazakhstan.  "This is a significant recalibration of the search," Malaysia's acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Sunday.  The plane disappeared on March 8, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The airline's CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said Sunday the missing passenger jet took off with its normal amount of fuel needed for the route, and did not have extra fuel on board that could have extended its range.  One of the nations involved in the search, Pakistan, said Sunday that the plane never showed up on its civilian radars and would have been treated as a threat if it had.  The Times of India reported that India's military also said there was no way the plane could have flown over India without being picked up on radar.  A study of the flight's cargo manifest showed there were no dangerous materials on board that concerned investigators, he told reporters.  Investigators are still looking into the backgrounds of the passengers to see if any of them were trained pilots.  "There are still a few countries who have yet to respond to our request for a background check," said Khalid Abu Bakar, inspector general of the Royal Malaysian Police Force. "But there are a few ... foreign intelligence agencies who have cleared all the(ir) passengers."  U.S. intelligence officials are leaning toward the theory that "those in the cockpit" -- the captain and co-pilot -- were responsible for the mysterious disappearance, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the latest thinking told CNN.  What we know about the cockpit crew  The official emphasized no final conclusions have been drawn and all the internal intelligence discussions are based on preliminary assessments of what is known to date.  Other scenarios could still emerge. The notion of a hijacking has not been ruled out, the official said Saturday.  Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told reporters on Saturday that the plane veered off course due to apparent deliberate action taken by somebody on board.  'Someone acting deliberately'  The first clue that the captain or co-pilot may have been involved stems from when the plane made a sharp, deliberate turn just after it last communicated with Kuala Lumpur air traffic controllers, and before it would have to communicate with Vietnamese controllers, according to the U.S. official with knowledge of the latest intelligence thinking.  "This is the perfect place to start to disappear," the official said.  Adding to the intrigue, ABC News reported that the dramatic left turn was preprogrammed into the plane's navigation computer. It's a task that would have required extensive piloting experience.  Two senior law enforcement officials also told ABC that new information revealed the plane performed "tactical evasion maneuvers" after it disappeared from radar. CNN was unable to confirm these reports.  Military radar showed the jetliner flew in a westerly direction back over the Malaysian peninsula, Najib said. It is then believed to have either turned northwest toward the Bay of Bengal or southwest elsewhere in the Indian Ocean, he said. The pilots  On Saturday, Malaysian police searched the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53. Shah lives in an upscale gated community in Shah Alam, outside Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur.  The Ministry of Transport said Sunday that police were examining a flight simulator found at the pilot's house a day earlier.  Two vans were loaded with small bags, similar to shopping bags, at the home of the co-pilot, 27-year-old Fariq Ab Hamid, according to a CNN crew who observed activities at the residence. It was unclear whether the bags were taken from the home, and police made no comment about their activities there.  Najib made clear in a press conference that in light of the latest developments...tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-03-16T19:37:11.000Zduration=PT9M32SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=51530likes=35dislikes=24favourite=0comments=60topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]1  Video: id=dharkT0N4_Utitle=MH370 Malaysia Airlines Flight 370description=http://adf.ly/?id=6792354 Register and start making money online now! promote your site here too if you want to!tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-02-27T08:23:31.000Zduration=PT44M36SisLiscensed=falsedefination=hdviews=5946likes=16dislikes=0favourite=0comments=12topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]0  Video: id=O-oWpDNxjUYtitle=Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 - Press Conference (March 15)description=From March 15, 2014 Background: http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/15/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-plane/index.html?hpt=hp_t1tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-03-15T14:45:31.000Zduration=PT15M47SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=366likes=4dislikes=1favourite=0comments=36topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]0  Video: id=8KC9qEzSue8title=CNN Breaking News Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 6th of Aprildescription=tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-04-06T12:58:43.000Zduration=PT16M20SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=889likes=1dislikes=0favourite=0comments=3topicIds=[/m/0gsgr, /m/05jhg, /m/0_x6q01]0  Video: id=pn6eehNVvXEtitle=Several ground witnesses claim they saw Malaysia Airlines Flight 370description=In the middle of the night, two fishermen near the Malaysia-Thailand border saw a plane flying low over the South China Sea -- at the same time that air traffic controllers lost contact with Flight 370 over the same body of water, at 1:30 a.m. or almost 50 minutes after takeoff. Fisherman Azid Ibrahim and a friend had taken people fishing that night off the coast of Kota Bharu. "I was fishing when I saw the plane -- it looked strange. Flying low. I told my friend that's not normal. Normally, it flies at 35,000 feet. But that night it touched the clouds. I thought the pilot must be crazy," Ibrahim said. "It was really low. I saw the lights they looked like the size of a coconut," he said. Their fishing grounds lay under a flight path, but the predawn plane was unusual to see because of its low altitude, they said. The fishermen filed a police report about their sighting, but Malaysian officials haven't commented.  missing flight 370, Malaysia Airlines (Airline), missing plane, malaysia airlines transponder, malaysia airlines hijack, malaysia airlines theory, malaysia airlines coverage, malaysia airlines flight mh370, missing plane Several ground witnesses claim they saw Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Malaysia Airlines, Boeing 777, 239 Onboard, breaking, new, news, Dahboo77, 2014, False, flag, attack, weather, earthquake, wow, wtf, crazy, look, must, see, conspiracy, truth, government, Obama, Dahbootags=nullpublishedAt=2014-03-20T01:50:16.000Zduration=PT2M11SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=1988likes=10dislikes=0favourite=0comments=5topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]0  Video: id=HeK6OPQuvlctitle=FSX - A Tribute To MH370 - Malaysian Airlines Flight 370description=I hope you like the Video, i took a few days to make, this is my first FSX Video.

Any answers. From anyone. The characteristically outspoken Courtney Love was the latest self-styled expert to weigh in with her theory last night on Twitter — which is marvelously evidence-based (!), as far as such theories go. Love, one of the thousands of people scouring crowdsourced satellite site Tomnod for signs of the plane, thinks it crashed into the ocean a mile from the small Malaysian island of Pulau Perak. But what of the Internet's more imaginative conspiracy theorists — you know, the ones who think the Defense Department orchestrates natural disasters and 9/11 was an inside job? They have a few ideas that make Love look like a veritable aviation expert. We trawled their message boards and YouTube channels so you don't have to. 1. The plane never crashed — it's just invisible! In a twist straight out of the"Star Wars" saga, some theorists are claiming that Flight 370 deployed "electronic weaponry" and "cloaking devices" that have simply hid it from radar detection. "Today's electronic warfare (EW) capability includes weaponry that can hide planes," argues an article on the skepticism-inducing WorthyToShare.net, which sadly offers no solution to how said weaponry would get on a passenger plane. 2. Flight 370 "shadowed" another plane into Indian airspace. An Ohio IT worker/hobby aviationist named Keith Ledgerwood apparently started a Tumblr for the sole purpose of propagating this theory — with pretty decent results. His lengthy post on how the missing plane could "hide" from radar by flying close to another jet has been reblogged nearly a thousand times. "It sounds totally crazy," an aircraft accident investigator told Business Insider. Crazy — but possible! Airplanes can indeed fly in formation. The chances of coordinating and timing such a coordination are just very, very slim. 3. The plane has been at a U.S. Navy base the whole time. The U.S. maintains a logistics base called Diego Garcia in the Chagos Archipelago. Because the Chagos Archipelago is in the Indian Ocean, and because Diego Garcia does indeed have a runway, many a theorist has joyfully concluded that the U.S. military either (a) captured the plane, (b) shot it down as it swooped in for an attack, or (c) planned to divert it to the installation all along. No one ever explains why the U.S. would take such an extraordinary measure, though The Total Collapse — a prepper Web site that predicts the apocalypse —  is convinced that the plane carried some "highly suspicious cargo" from Seychelles. It doesn't exactly help that Diego Garcia is, per a book by American University's David Vine, "one of the most strategically important and secretive U.S. military installations outside the United States." As maps of the search area make pretty clear, however, the island is far from either of the routes suggested by Flight 370's last satellite contact — which would put it west of Perth, Australia, or above the southeast Asian mainland. 4. The plane was shot down by a hostile country that is not the U.S. This gem comes courtesy of radio host Rush Limbaugh, who posited that "some hostile country flew up there and shot it down, and then discovered their mistake and nobody wants to admit what happened," immediately after acknowledging that he had no idea "if this is possible" or not. 5. Flight 370 was hijacked by extremists — possibly jihadists — who may re-outfit the plane for an attack. None other than media mogul Rupert Murdoch has advanced the hijacking theory, arguing on Twitter that the plane is hidden, "like Bin Laden" (!), in Northern Pakistan. Others have read nefarious future plans into the hijacking, fed by a weekend report in the Telegraph that al-Qaeda may have, at one time, been planning a "9/11-style attack" with Malaysian extremists. Pakistan has said its radars never picked up a jet. 6. The flight was abducted by aliens. "You really need to consider Santa Clause here bro," retorted a user on the conspiracy forum Above Top Secret — one of many, many places where the alien/time-space continuum/wormhole theory has been proposed. 7. The Illuminati planned it — and even warned the world in a Pitbull song! Pitbull seems like an unlikely herald of the coming New World Order, but some amazingly earnest YouTube commenters insist that his 2012 song "Get It Started," featuring Shakira, alludes to the plane's disappearance. The lyrics contain a passing reference to Malaysia: "but for now it's off to Malaysia/two passports, three cities, two countries, one day." Per the YouTube masses, the "two passports" are the two stolen passports used by Iranian passengers apparently migrating to Europe, and the three cities are Kuala Lumpur, Beijing and wherever the plane is now. Alas, Pitbull and his Illuminati masters did not think to include that third location in the song.tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-03-19T00:01:57.000Zduration=PT2M34SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=135951likes=117dislikes=31favourite=0comments=140topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]1  Video: id=7-SofI70ea4title=Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Audio is Edited Latest Newsdescription=The Malaysian government finally released a recording today with their report of the conversation between Malaysian Flight 370 and Air Traffic Control.

FLIGHT 370: THE MISSING LINKS will air in more than 220 countries and territories worldwide on Discovery Channel. In Southeast Asia, FLIGHT 370: THE MISSING LINKS will first air exclusively on Discovery Channel.  The mystery of flight MH370 has garnered worldwide attention and generated widespread speculation about how the events unfolded. FLIGHT 370: THE MISSING LINKS looks to industry experts to account for just how it is possible to lose track of an airliner -- analysing evidence, deliberating the global frailties of aviation and divulging potential solutions to prevent the disappearance of an aircraft from ever happening again.  In an age when we can use apps to locate handheld devices, the special also looks at how a state-of-the-art airliner and its 239 passengers and crew can simply vanish. Since flight MH370 went off the grid on 8March 2014, questions about flight safety have once again taken centre stage. In an attempt to answer some of these questions, FLIGHT 370: THE MISSING LINKS addresses seven missing links: airport security, air traffic control, on-board communication systems, mechanical failure, tracking (both radar and satellite), international cooperation, and the black box.tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-04-20T18:13:37.000Zduration=PT43M40SisLiscensed=falsedefination=hdviews=178914likes=323dislikes=33favourite=0comments=161topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]0  Video: id=gvGdwYGgmMItitle=New Theory Emerges on the Disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370description=New signal indicates the plane may have veered radically off course.tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-03-12T01:04:02.000Zduration=PT2M34SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=48796likes=117dislikes=11favourite=0comments=41topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]1  Video: id=vBbz5o49bEgtitle=Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: A timelinedescription=Jeff Pegues provides a timeline from the moment the Malaysia Airlines flight took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport on March 8, to the plane's last satellite contact.tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-03-19T23:52:08.000Zduration=PT1M58SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=7616likes=16dislikes=2favourite=0comments=5topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]0  Video: id=eerVV6bRH6Ytitle=Virtual look at Flight 370's routedescription=CNN's Tom Foreman gives a virtual look at the flight path of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-03-11T23:03:44.000Zduration=PT1M48SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=70815likes=62dislikes=16favourite=0comments=38topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l]0  Video: id=-JzmK3-tIvQtitle=Anonymous - The real reason why the Malaysian Airline MH 370 disappeareddescription=Independent & Investigative News: http://AnonHQ.com Become Anonymous:http://www.anonhq.com/be-anonymous JOIN US: https://www.facebook.com/ArmyAnonymous Follow us on Twitter: https://www.facebook.com/AnonymousNewsHQ With the disappearance of those on Malaysian Airlines MH370 billionaire, Jacob Rothschild becomes the sole owner of an important semiconductor patent.   Coincidence? I think not! The mysteries surrounding Malaysian Airliner MH-370 continue to grow with each passing day and Mr. Rothschild is smack dab in the middle.  Illuminati member, Rothschild, is believed to have exploited the airliner to gain full Patent Rights of an incredible KL-03 micro-chip. The US technological company, Freescale Semiconductor, who shared its rights with Rothschild, had twenty senior members on board who had just launched a new electronic warfare gadget for military radar system's the day before the plane went missing.     The Semiconductor company develops microprocessors, sensors, and other technology including stand-alone semiconductors that perform dedicated computing functions.  But the questions that arise are why were there so many Freescale employees traveling together? What were their jobs? Their mission? And did they employees carry valuable cargo? With all the power our elite carry, why couldn't they track down the missing plane?  Furthermore it owns Freescale RF which is involved in making solutions for Aerospace and Defense including: Battlefield communications, Avionics, HF Radar -- Band L and S, Missile Guidance, Electronic Warfare, and Identification (IFF).     But here's where it gets even more interesting. The Freescale's shareholders include the Carlyle Group who's past advisors have included ex-US president George Bush Sr and former British Prime Minister John Major. Some of the companies previous clients include the construction firm owned by the family of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Binladin Group.  The company [Freescale] did not respond to questions from Express Online, including whether any of its missing employees had been working on the defense products.  It neither provided any responses to the latest bizarre conspiracy theory being widely published on the comments sections of newspaper websites and other internet forums.  The comment reads: "It reads: "Have you pieced together the puzzle of missing flight 370 to Beijing China? If not, here are your missing pieces.  Four days after the flight MH370 disappear, semiconductor patent was approved by the U.S. patent office patent is divided in parts of 20% between five starters. One of the owners is the company itself, Freescale Semiconductor, Austin, Texas (USA), and the other four Chinese employees of the company: Peidong Wang, Zhijun Chen, Cheng and Li Ying Zhijong, all the Suzhou City. And they all passengers of Malaysia Airlines plane disappeared on March 8, according Eternity."  It adds: "Here is your motive for the missing Beijing plane. As all four Chinese members of the Patent were passengers on the missing plane."     Patent holders can alter the proceeds legally by passing wealth to their heirs. "However, they cannot do so until the Patent is approved. So when the plane went missing, the patent had not been approved."  Although a Freescale patent exists under number US8650327, none of the names listed actually appear on the passenger manifest released by the Malaysian authorities.  If the patent holder dies, the other owners share equally in dividends from the deceased. If four of the five patentees die, then the patentee left alive gets 100% of the patent. That remaining patent holder is the company Freescale Semiconductor. Who owns Freescale Semiconductor? The answer is: Jacob Rothschild. British billionaire owns the company Blackstone, which in turn owns the company Freescale Semiconductors. Several speculations on the Internet now pay attention to this circumstance. The Rothschilds are a dynasty of financiers and international bankers of German-Jewish origin . The family is from the nineteenth century one of the most influential families of bankers and financiers of Europe."  To See Patent Upclose: http://truthnewsinternational.files.w...  Is this just another coincidence? I don't think so.  Rothschild is hiding evidence to gain the rights to this semiconductor. He wants power and he wants his money! It may have taken 239 deaths to do it, but to him, that's just part of population control. In the end, he gets him money, his fame, and his power; all while the world remains silent. Makes you sick doesn't it!   Time to expose this fraud for who he is!

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370/MAS370) was a scheduled international passenger flight that disappeared on 8 March 2014, while flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing Capital International Airport in Beijing, China. Flight 370 last made voice contact with air traffic control at 01:19 MYT (17:19 UTC, 7 March) when it was over the South China Sea, less than an hour after takeoff. The aircraft disappeared from air traffic controllers' radar screens at 01:21. Malaysian military radar continued to track Flight 370 as it deviated from its planned flight path and crossed the Malay Peninsula. Flight 370 left the range of Malaysian military radar at 02:22 while over the Andaman Sea, 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) northwest of Penang in northwestern Malaysia. The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was carrying 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 15 nations.  A multinational search effort began in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea, where the flight's signal was lost on secondary surveillance radar, and was soon extended to the Strait of Malacca and Andaman Sea. Analysis of satellite communications between the aircraft and Inmarsat's satellite communications network concluded that the flight continued until at least 08:19 MYT and flew south into the southern Indian Ocean, although the precise location cannot be determined;Australia took charge of the search effort on 17 March, when the search shifted to the southern Indian Ocean. On 24 March 2014, the Malaysian government, noting that the final location determined by the satellite communication is far from any possible landing sites, concluded that "flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean." The current phase of the search is a comprehensive search of the seafloor about 1,800 kilometres (1,100 mi) southwest of Perth, Australia, which began in October 2014. Despite being the largest and most expensive search in aviation history, there has been no confirmation of any flight debris, resulting in speculations about its disappearance.  Malaysia established the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to investigate the incident, working with foreign aviation authorities and experts. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished. Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were initially suspect in the disappearance, but they were later determined to be asylum seekers and terrorism has been ruled out. Malaysian police have identified the Captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all other passengers of any suspicious motives. Power was lost to the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat's satellite communication network at 02:25—three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar. Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of Sumatra and flew for five hours without communication and with little deviation in its track, suggesting that the aircraft was flying on autopilot without manual input from the cockpit and that Flight 370 may have experienced a hypoxia event, ending when fuel was exhausted.  At the time of its disappearance, and if the presumed loss of all on board is confirmed, Flight 370 was the deadliest aviation incident in Malaysia Airlines' history and the deadliest involving a Boeing 777. It was surpassed in both regards 131 days later by the crash of another Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 – Flight 17 – that was shot down over Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines was struggling financially, a problem which was exacerbated by a decline in ticket sales after Flight 370 disappeared and before the crash of Flight 17; the airline was renationalised by the end of 2014. The Malaysian government received significant criticism, especially from China, for failing to disclose information in a timely manner during the early weeks of the search. Flight 370's disappearance brought to the public's attention the limits of aircraft tracking and flight recorders, including several issues raised four years earlier - but never mandated - following the loss of Air France Flight 447. A task force set up by the International Air Transport Association, with the support of the International Civil Aviation Organization, proposed a new standard that, by December 2015, commercial aircraft report their positions every 15 minutes. The Malaysian Ministry of Transport issued an interim report on 8 March 2015.tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-05T23:01:56.000Zduration=PT50M25SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=3088likes=37dislikes=2favourite=0comments=10topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/05czz6l, /m/0bqkj3, /m/015xf8, /m/013_0l]0  Video: id=Oj3981NSZS4title=Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: New account of pilot's last words from missing jetdescription=Malaysian authorities released a full transcript of communications between Flight 370 and air traffic control before it disappeared.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: "Patents Patents Patents?"  "Have you pieced together the puzzle of missing flight 370 to Beijing China ? If not, here are your missing pieces.  Patents Patents Patents  4 days after the missing flight MH370 a patent is approved by the Patent  Office, 4 of the 5 Patent holders are Chinese employees of Freescale  Semiconductor of Austin TX.  Patent is divided up on 20% increments to 5 holders.      Peidong Wang, Suzhou, China, (20%)    Zhijun Chen, Suzhou, China, (20%)    Zhihong Cheng, Suzhou, China, (20%)    Li Ying, Suzhou, China, (20%)    Freescale Semiconductor (20%)  If a patent holder dies, then the remaining holders equally share the dividends of the deceased if not disputed in a will. If 4 of the 5 dies, then the remaining 1 Patent holder gets 100% of the wealth of the patent.  That remaining live Patent holder is Freescale Semiconductor. Who owns Freescale Semiconductor ?? Jacob Rothschild through Blackstone who owns Freescale. Here is your motive for the missing Beijing plane. As all 4 Chinese members of the Patent were passengers on the missing plane.  Patent holders can alter the proceeds legally by passing wealth to their  heirs. However, they cannot do so until the Patent is approved. So when the  plane went missing, the patent had not been approved.  Thus, Rothschild gets 100% of Patent once Patent holders declared  deceased."  The patent that got this online message started is this one, US 008671381,  from March 11, 2014: Saved copy: http://truthnewsinternational.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/us008671381.pdf     Original: A, B  The names listed on the patent, i.e. Wang Peidong, Chen Zhijun, Cheng Zhihong  and Ying Li are the same as in the online message. However, according to the  March 8, 2014, passenger manifest(original) of Malaysia Airlines flight 370  these persons were not on that plane. If they were then their names are not  listed.   Were there Freescale employees on board? Yes. And also at least one from IBM. Is Freescale Semiconductor owned by Blackstone?  On April 27, 2013, Bloomberg published an article about the company in  which it is confirmed that Freescale is indeed a Blackstone venture:   "Blackstone-Owned Freescale Rises as Forecast Tops Estimates: Freescale  Semiconductor Ltd. (FSL), the chipmaker mostly owned by a private-equity group  including Blackstone Group LP (BX) and TPG Capital, rose after predicting  second-quarter sales that may exceed some analysts' estimates."  Is Rothschild linked to Blackstone? Yes, he is a Member of the  International Advisory Board. Is Blackstone one of the parties who are responsible for the missing  airplane, flight 370?   The answer to that question can likely only come from those who  ordered/organized the AWACS mission of March 8, 2014.  awacs, ecm, electronic counter measure, The electronic counter measure (ECM) capability aboard the AWACS allows its user to jam radar frequencies and communications of the enemy radar  Aside from the patent message that is circulating online, here are some other links to photos and info that one may find interesting to copy and save for future reference, for you never know how data and narratives might change since the photos of the "suspects" were horribly FAKED, on purpose of course.  http://www.redicecreations.com/article.php?id=29355tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-03-16T21:35:41.000Zduration=PT3M42SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=70478likes=197dislikes=26favourite=0comments=157topicIds=[/m/0_x6q01, /m/013_0l, /m/05sq5]1  Video: id=qK_jFJofafMtitle=Air Crash Investigation: Where Is Malaysia 370?description=Malaysia Airlines,Plane Crashes In,South China Sea,With 239 People Aboard,Live Update,Malaysia,Airlines,plane,crashes,off,Vietnam,coast,Airline.,Audi,New Ca... . .

The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 leaves everybody wondering. What happened?  5. The pilot committed suicide  Though uncommon, there have been 24 cases of in-flight pilot suicide over the last two decades. SilkAir Flight 185 and EgyptAir Flight 990 are the two commonly cited examples of this type of tragedy. In both cases, investigators concluded that the pilots deliberately caused the crashes.  4. Financial motive  The disappearance of the flight may be the result of psychological or personal problems of someone on board, said police chief Bakar. "Maybe somebody on the flight has bought a huge sum of insurance, who wants family to gain from it or somebody who has owed somebody so much money," he proposed at a news conference days after the plane vanished.  3. Sabotage  Given reports that the plane's communications transponders were deliberately turned off — one after the other — investigators believe sabotage is a possibility. Someone on board seemingly changed the plane's course — and deliberately masked its location from radar systems. Turning off the plane's transponder "would require disabling a circuit breaker above and behind an overhead panel. Pilots rarely, if ever, need to access the circuit breakers, which are reserved for maintenance personnel."  2. Hijacked  Police chief Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters that the criminal investigation was now focused on four possible scenarios, one of which is a hijacking. If it was hijacked, though, what was the plan? That much, investigators don't know. Most hijackings end with a ransom exchange or, as we saw on 9/11, a much more public display of destruction. MH370, it appears, ended in the Indian Ocean, or did it...?  1. A catastrophic event  Satellite data showed that the plane flew off radar for up to seven hours — meaning that the plane continued traveling until its fuel ran out. It's possible that everyone on board was unconscious or dead due to explosives or rapid or slow decompression, which can occur from a number of instances while traveling in an aircraft. If they ran out of oxygen the plane possibly continued to fly on autopilot for hours and could have crashed anywhere after running out of fuel.

It's a raging debate after Flipkart, one of India's most iconic startups, finds itself in the midst of a controversy over whether its agreement with Airtel Zero violates the principle of net neutrality. Under the agreement, Airtel users would incur no charges for using the Flipkart app with the company reimbursing Airtel directly for this. Critics argue that this alters the nature of the Internet as a leveler where big players like Flipkart and smaller companies have equal access to consumers.

What is Net Neutrality?description=(License: This video is licensed under Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication. You can share and use it however you want. Read more here: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)  Net neutrality (also network neutrality or Internet neutrality) is the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, and modes of communication.  Net Neutrality is extremely important to promote technological innovation, boost economic progress, and to ensure that we don't lose a medium of free speech and thought.  The Indian telecom regulator (TRAI) has proposed 20 questions for your views on two basic topics: a. Should there be licensing of Internet services, and b. Should there be non-discrimination of Internet access via telecom operators.  Please act before 24th April, 2015 and send your views to - advqos@trai.gov.in.

And also to recognize that the win would not have happened without the people who worked hard to lobby and bug their congresspeople and force a decision down the throat of a bunch of unhappy corporations. So thank you so much to everyone who campaigned to keep the internet neutral.

While this does not directly imply that shit has hit the fan, it could allow Telecos to charge you seperately for each WhatsApp message, or make you pay equivalent charges for Skype calls etc.  Why should I take your word for this?  Here are some news and editorial articles on this:  medianama:  http://www.medianama.com/2015/03/223-should-india-have-licensing-of-internet-services-net-neutrality-trai-wants-your-views/  Indian Express: http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/trai-seeks-to-regulate-ott-players-like-skype-viber-whatsapp-and-google-talk/  Wait, you lied to me! The TRAI wants my opinion on this!  Okay, So what should I do?  As you've read (and I hope you've read that), the TRAI wants your opinion on this. Shit hasn't hit the fan yet, and we can turn this around before this actually becomes a serious consideration. So, the first thing you can do is to e-mail the TRAI on their comments email, which is : advqos@trai.gov.in You probably shouldn't copypasta someone else's email on this as it will lead to them beleiving that a few people are spamming their inbox. Some tooltips on what to write would be:  Some tooltips on what to write would be:  - Refer to the recent Net Neutrality agitation, and the subsequent FCC ruling, - Talk about how loss of revenue to Telecos should not be the bar to progress, - Talk about how Net Neutrality laws have already been enacted in The Netherlands after a similar agitation there, - If you want to, talk about how rulings in favour of allowing said regulation are anti-development, and not what you expect from the Government.  What else can I do?  You can tweet the issue out and raise publicity. Since this ruling affects widely used services such as WhatsApp and Skype, more people should be willing to listen.  Dude all this takes too long.  Well, yeah, you can either take 5 minutes now or bitch endlessly later. It's your choice.

The plan, which puts the Internet in the same regulatory camp as the telephone and bans business practices that are "unjust or unreasonable," represents the biggest regulatory shakeup to the industry in almost two decades. The goal is to prevent providers from slowing or blocking web traffic, or creating paid “fast lanes” on the Internet, said FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler.  The 3-2 vote was expected to trigger industry lawsuits that could take several years to resolve. Still, consumer advocates cheered the regulations as a victory for smaller Internet-based companies, who had feared they would have to pay "tolls" to move their content."* The Young Turks hosts Cenk Uygur & John Iadarola break it down.  *Read more here: http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/2/26/fcc-allows-city-owned-internet-providers-to-expand1.html  **********  ISIS, Police Shooting, O'Reilly, Net Neutrality & CPAC - The Young Turks 2/26/2015 News & Politics http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTpcK80irdQgKQyPbycR1j-7Cvrc4k1U4  **********  Buy MAD AS HELL on iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/mad-as-hell/id959174781 Also on other digital platforms, DVD, & Blu-ray at: http://www.MadAsHellFilm.com  **********  Support TYT while shopping on Amazon through this link (bookmark it!) http://www.amazon.com/?tag=theyoungturks-20  The Largest Online News Show in the World.

Yes, they’re here to talk about Net Neutrality, and just how much of a concern it should be for the public. If you’re even a little bit confused about what net neutrality is, and why you should care about it, this video will clear things up for you. With their analogies that are absolutely spot-on, you’ll understand why you need to fight telecom operators who are going to make you pay for the websites you use by controlling the speed of your internet connection or providing paid partner services free of cost.  We need to fight this. Because the internet is a free space, and no one should be allowed to make a business out of it.  www.savetheinternet.intags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-12T11:55:22.000Zduration=PT9M8SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=14875likes=339dislikes=5favourite=0comments=11topicIds=[/m/04zdxn]0  Video: id=mc2aso6W7jQtitle=Hank vs. Hank: The Net Neutrality Debate in 3 Minutesdescription=In which Hank debates Hank on one of the most important debates in the United States today, whether to keep the internet open or to allow cable companies to open fast lanes (and slow lanes) for different parts of the internet to flow through.

Anti-trust watchdog CCI might also launch a probe into schemes launched by some telecom operators, including Airtel, Reliance Communications and Uninor, that claim to provide 'free' access to certain internet applications, even as the companies defended their stand saying these initiatives did not go against 'net neutrality'. Social media platforms like Twitter continued to remain abuzz, as politicians, filmstars, start-ups and corporates joined the debate, while Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also said there needs to be a debate on the issue. Net neutrality implies equal treatment to all Internet traffic and any priority given to an application or company on payment basis is seen as violating the concept. Telecom regulator TRAI, which last month floated a discussion paper on this, is also looking into the issue. "Non discriminatory net availability is what we need to strive for," Telecom and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, while adding that an expert committee was looking into the matter and should submit its report within a month to help the government make an informed decision.  According to the Minister, Internet is one of the finest creations of the human mind and it is a property of the entire human race and not of any country or society. "Internet to become entirely global should have a link to local and when we talk of digital inclusion it must be available to the underprivileged and on the margins," he said. Sparking off the debate, telecom major Bharti Airtel launched its 'Airtel Zero' marketing platform -- where certain apps are available for free with charges borne by app makers. Many free Internet advocates and start-ups feel that Airtel's platform could even "lead to monopolisation by a few and squeeze out the small companies". Airtel itself has defended its move saying the initiative would be a 'win-win' for customers and marketers alike. Coming out in support of initiatives like that of Airtel, e-commerce major Flipkart.com's founder Sachin Bansal, tweeted, "when foreign companies do it in India - innovation. Indians do it - violation".  In a debate moderated by TIMES NOW's Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami, panelists -- Tanmay Bhat, Comedian & Co-Founder, AIB; Roshan Abbas, Writer & Director; Priyanka Chaturvedi, Spokesperson, Congress; Shazia Ilmi, Leader, BJP; Raghav Chadha, Leader, AAP; T V Ramachandran, Chairman, ASSOCHAM Telecom Council and Rajan Matthews, Director General, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) -- discuss the issue -- how can telecom companies decide what you want to access?

All thoughts and opinions presented are the province of Mike Rugnetta.  Is the internet a public utility? No. Should it be? That's an interesting question. The Internet, as we've said many a time, is a glorious series of tubes, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) sell us access to those tubes. But the FCC is considering a new Two Tiered system, in which some companies could pay ISPs for faster delivery. This topic (aka Net Neutrality) has made us think about the important role the internet plays in our lives. Is internet access so important that it should be classified as a public utility or common carrier, like water & electricity, or public buses and subways? Watch the episode and find out!

Pai is an oustpoken opponent of expanding government control of the internet, including FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's plan to regulate Internet Service Providers (ISPs) under the same Title II rules that are used to govern telephone-service providers as public utilities. Under current FCC regulations, ISPs are considered providers of "information services" and subject to essentially no federal regulation.  He is also sharply critical of President Barack Obama's very public push to influence policy at the FCC, which is technically an independent agency. Last year, it was widely believed that Wheeler, a former head of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, would not push for Title II. Pai calls the president's actions—which included "creating a YouTube video of with very specific prescriptions as to what this agency should do"—unprecedented in his experience. Coupled with the fact that "the agency suddenly chang[ed]course from where it was to mimic the president’s plan," says Pai, "suggests that the independence of the agency has been compromised to some extent."  The FCC is scheduled to vote Thursday, February 26 on Wheeler's plan.  Pai explains his opposition to Title II reclassifcation to Reason's Nick Gillespie. Citing independent studies of American competitiveness and booming investment in telecommunications infrastructure compared to Europe, Pai argues that consumers are thriving and the market is doing its job.  Regulating the internet like a utility company, says Pai, will threaten the kind of innovation we've taken for granted over the past 20 years. "Do you trust the federal government to make the Internet ecosystem more vibrant than it is today?" Pai asks. "Can you think of any regulated utility like the electric company or water company that is as innovative as the Internet?"  Runs about 30 minutes.  Produced by Todd Krainin.

In public speeches he has repeatedly cast doubt on the Bible, he has repeatedly stated that he does not believe that Jesus is necessary for salvation. At the same time, Obama has always referred to Muhammed as "the Prophet", he has always expressed great love and respect for Islam.  20 Quotes By Barack Obama About Islam  #1 "The future must not belong to those who slander the Prophet of Islam" #2 "The sweetest sound I know is the Muslim call to prayer" #3 "We will convey our deep appreciation for the Islamic faith, which has done so much over the centuries to shape the world — including in my own country." #4 "As a student of history, I also know civilization's debt to Islam." #5 "Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance." #6 "Islam has always been part of America" #7 "we will encourage more Americans to study in Muslim communities" #8 "These rituals remind us of the principles that we hold in common, and Islam's role in advancing justice, progress, tolerance, and the dignity of all human beings." #9 "America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition. Instead, they overlap, and share common principles of justice and progress, tolerance and the dignity of all human beings." #10 "I made clear that America is not -- and never will be -- at war with Islam." #11 "Islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism -- it is an important part of promoting peace." #12 "So I have known Islam on three continents before coming to the region where it was first revealed" #13 "In ancient times and in our times, Muslim communities have been at the forefront of innovation and education." #14 "throughout history, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality." #15 "Ramadan is a celebration of a faith known for great diversity and racial equality" #16 "The Holy Koran tells us, 'O mankind! We have created you male and a female; and we have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another.'" #17 "I look forward to hosting an Iftar dinner celebrating Ramadan here at the White House later this week, and wish you a blessed month." #18 "We've seen those results in generations of Muslim immigrants -- farmers and factory workers, helping to lay the railroads and build our cities, the Muslim innovators who helped build some of our highest skyscrapers and who helped unlock the secrets of our universe." #19 "That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islam must be based on what Islam is, not what it isn't. And I consider it part of my responsibility as president of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear." #20 "I also know that Islam has always been a part of America's story."  5 Quotes By Barack Obama About Christianity  #1 "Whatever we once were, we are no longer a Christian nation" #2 "We do not consider ourselves a Christian nation." #3 "Which passages of scripture should guide our public policy?  Should we go with Leviticus, which suggests slavery is OK and that eating shellfish is an abomination?  Or we could go with Deuteronomy, which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith?" #4 "Even those who claim the Bible's inerrancy make distinctions between Scriptural edicts, sensing that some passages -- the Ten Commandments, say, or a belief in Christ's divinity -- are central to Christian faith, while others are more culturally specific and may be modified to accommodate modern life." #5 "The American people intuitively understand this, which is why the majority of Catholics practice birth control and some of those opposed to gay marriage nevertheless are opposed to a Constitutional amendment to ban it. Religious leadership need not accept such wisdom in counseling their flocks, but they should recognize this wisdom in their politics."tags=nullpublishedAt=2014-07-22T22:18:33.000Zduration=PT9M30SisLiscensed=falsedefination=hdviews=11870likes=62dislikes=11favourite=0comments=51topicIds=[/m/02mjmr, /m/04y29, /m/0flw86]Malaysia Airlines Flight 3701  Video: id=GqkZBWd6-nItitle=4-Star Admiral Slams Obama: Muslim Brotherhood Infiltrated All Of Our National Security Agenciesdescription=During a press conference on how to combat radical Islamic extremism, Admiral James A. “Ace” Lyons (U.S. Navy, Ret.), former Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, stated that under the leadership of Barack Obama the Muslim Brotherhood have infiltrated all of the National Security Agencies of the United States. Furthermore, Lyons said that Obama is deliberately unilaterally disarming the military and spoke to the need for the new GOP controlled congress and Military leaders to stand up to the administration and uphold their oaths.tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-01-28T19:17:16.000Zduration=PT9M21SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=213484likes=1088dislikes=60favourite=0comments=280topicIds=[/m/02mjmr, /m/056rs, /m/0hfq_]1  Video: id=-tKMiRxnRN4title=A Muslim In The White House - Proof Barack Hussein Obama Is A Secret Muslimdescription=This ground breaking documentary film finally proves that Barack Hussein Obama is a secret Muslim.  This video examines all of the ties Obama has to the Muslim world, and it also examines everything he has ever said about Islam and Muslims in general.  You will be shocked at the amount of evidence that is piled up against him, including what he says about Islam, and the actions he takes towards Islam.  Every American including Republican and Democrat, should finally see Obama for the man he really is, a Muslim hiding in plain sight.  . . Critics will argue that Obama's secret religion doesn't matter.  But how can the American people elect a Muslim for President right after the tragic events of 9/11?  Electing a Muslim to the White House right after 9/11, is the equivalent to electing a Nazi for President right after the holocaust.    Every American should realize that electing a Muslim for President is a direct insult to the victims of 9/11, and is tantamount to spitting on their still smoldering graves.tags=nullpublishedAt=2011-05-27T14:52:58.000Zduration=PT43M47SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=494263likes=2343dislikes=848favourite=0comments=3884topicIds=[/m/02mjmr, /m/04y29]1  Video: id=l1XZeuugMt0title=The American Muslim Brotherhood President - Barack Hussein Obamadescription=What if this is true and the American people and the world, have been tricked in the biggest hoax in history? What if Barack Hussein Obama really is a muslim implant, a pre-appointed candidate for the Muslim Brotherhood, paid for by Saudi Arabia, in a secret, but some times very obvious, scheme to conquer America and help establish the Islamic Caliphate? They said they killed Osama Bin Laden, a bit strange to kill an allied, if they did? He snuggled on his pillow, getting ready for a show in Las Vegas instead of leading a rescue team to Benghazi where he let his buddy Mohammed Morsi arrange a Muslim Brotherhood attack on the embassy in Libya while dreaming of a successful raid to cover up the gun dealing to Al-Qaeda. Kurt Sutter would be inspired, cause it's like a good episode of Sons Of Anarchy. He pulls soldiers out of Iraq and Afghanistan, which is a good thing, but he's making them unemployed and on welfare. Maybe he received the Nobel Peace Prize for that perhaps? Who knows? While arming the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, he also ship arms to the rebel forces in Syria. FSA (Free Syrian Army), a bunch of Jihadists from all over the world, trying to help bring Assad down, as he has succeeded with in several other countries in the middle-east, and has also promoted Sharia with his cousin in his homeland of Kenya. Not my words, but Michelle Obama's. Of course that's part of the Muslim Brotherhood's plan, to clear the region of dictators and implement Sharia. Obama claims to be a Christian but why would a Christian wear a ring with the Arabic inscription "There is no God except Allah?"; which he understands very well by the way. Why would a Christian even say the words: "My muslim faith?" - Could it be because he is one of them? Time will tell.  OVER - A controversial new book to be released in 2013.

It was the first Valentine I got.  (Laughter.)  I got it from Sabrina before Malia and Sasha and Michelle gave me one.  (Laughter.)  So she’s 11 years old.  She’s in the 5th grade.  She’s a young Muslim American.  And she said in her Valentine, “I enjoy being an American.”  And when she grows up, she wants to be an engineer -- or a basketball player.  (Laughter.)  Which are good choices. (Laughter.)  But she wrote, “I am worried about people hating Muslims…If some Muslims do bad things, that doesn’t mean all of them do.”  And she asked, “Please tell everyone that we are good people and we’re just like everyone else.”  (Applause.)  Now, those are the words -- and the wisdom -- of a little girl growing up here in America, just like my daughters are growing up here in America.  “We’re just like everybody else.”  And everybody needs to remember that during the course of this debate.    As we move forward with these challenges, we all have responsibilities, we all have hard work ahead of us on this issue.  We can’t paper over problems, and we’re not going to solve this if we’re always just trying to be politically correct. But we do have to remember that 11-year-old girl.  That’s our hope.  That’s our future.  That’s how we discredit violent ideologies, by making sure her voice is lifted up; making sure she’s nurtured; making sure that she’s supported -- and then, recognizing there are little girls and boys like that all around the world, and us helping to address economic and political grievances that can be exploited by extremists, and empowering local communities, and us staying true to our values as a diverse and tolerant society even when we’re threatened -- especially when we’re threatened.    There will be a military component to this.  There are savage cruelties going on out there that have to be stopped.  ISIL is killing Muslims at a rate that is many multiples the rate that they’re killing non-Muslims.  Everybody has a stake in stopping them, and there will be an element of us just stopping them in their tracks with force.  But to eliminate the soil out of which they grew, to make sure that we are giving a brighter future to everyone and a lasting sense of security, then we're going to have to make it clear to all of our children -- including that little girl in 5th grade -- that you have a place. You have a place here in America.  You have a place in those countries where you live.  You have a future.   Ultimately, those are the antidotes to violent extremism.  And that's work that we're going to have to do together.  It will take time.  This is a generational challenge.  But after 238 years, it should be obvious -- America has overcome much bigger challenges, and we’ll overcome the ones that we face today.  We will stay united and committed to the ideals that have shaped us for more than two centuries, including the opportunity and justice and dignity of every single human being.    Thank you very much, everybody.

"We will carry out the law, and the Americans will not stop us," she said. "We need to open the files and begin court sessions.

Remember when he and his campaign DENIED his Muslim connection?   Remember when using his middle name was forbidden in the campaign for fear that it might emphasize his Muslim roots?  This film tells a different story.  Hear Obama proclaim his Muslim heritage, faith, knowledge of the Koran - his love for Islam - his quoting of the Koran.  Hear him proclaim that the USA is NOT a Christian nation. Hear him and see him as he extols the wonderful virtues of the Muslim faith  and the Muslim impact upon the "beautiful" things of the world.  (Something he has NEVER done concerning the USA or the Christian faith.)  Watch it till the end for a rather dramatic and shocking conclusion.  NOTE TO OBAMAMANIACS - Yes - I KNOW he was often speaking to Muslim countries and was just "being polite." I UNDERSTAND that  - that is the POINT of the film. He said ONE THING to the USA when he was running and now says ANOTHER thing to the Muslim world.   But, wait, what does he say? 1. He has strong Muslim heritage and ties 2. The Koran is a "beautiful" book  3. Islam is a "beautiful" religion 4. Islam has made many "wonderful" contributions to society 5. We are NOT at war with Islam. 6. America is NOT a Christian nation.  ALL of these things he either DENIED or played down during his campaign.  This film simply proves BHO to be a LIAR.    It is plain and simple.tags=nullpublishedAt=2009-11-12T18:20:29.000Zduration=PT6M44SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=652227likes=0dislikes=0favourite=0comments=126topicIds=[/m/02mjmr, /m/04y29]1  Video: id=rIVfbH9Lytgtitle=A Message to President Obama from a former Muslimdescription=Brother Rachid, addresses President Obama about the relationship between the Religion of Islam and the Islamic State.

North Charleston officer Michael Slager was charged in the Saturday morning shooting death of Walter “Lamar” Scott, 50, which was captured on video by an unidentified witness. A magistrate denied Slager bond at a hearing Tuesday evening and he was being held at the Charleston County Detention Center.  Judy Scott, the victim’s mother, said her son was a caring person, someone who still called her “Mommy” in adulthood and was raised in the church.  “When I looked at that tape, that was the most horrible thing I’ve ever seen. I am very, very upset concerning it. I almost couldn’t look at it. To see my son running, defenselessly being shot, it just tore my heart to pieces,” she said on "Good Morning America" today.  Judy Scott said her faith has sustained her during her time of mourning.  “I feel sad for the officer who did the shooting, because he’s gonna have to give account for that. And I pray that he would repent to the Lord for what has happened, and we cannot move and act so quickly, we have to think before we take action and remember that we all have … that’s my son. And I’ve lost a son that will never come back. We have his memories, but he will never come back. And I pray that this never happens to anybody else,” she said.  The victim’s brother Anthony Scott said the murder charge was a positive development, but ultimately comes with mixed emotions.  “It is unusual right now, but I feel like we have a little bit more of the process to do. A charge is not being convicted,” Anthony Scott said. “Once a conviction is put in place, I’ll feel a whole lot better.”  Scott had four children. The family says it will file a civil suit.tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-08T14:51:25.000Zduration=PT6M12SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=5393likes=22dislikes=10favourite=0comments=47topicIds=null0  Video: id=aCgbWqXf0lstitle=The Truth About the Walter Scott Shootingdescription=In today's video, Christopher Greene of AMTV reports on the Walter Scott shooting in South Carolina.

SC Cop Faces Murder Charge After Video Shows Him Fatally Shoot Unarmed Black Man in Back As He Runs Away North Charleston officer to face murder charge after video shows him shooting man in back (The Post And Courier) A video that shows a North Charleston police officer shooting at 50-year-old Walter Scott’s back at least eight times as he ran away resulted in the lawman’s arrest Tuesday, officials said.  The development came as the State Law Enforcement Division looked into whether Patrolman 1st Class Michael Slager, 33, acted lawfully when he shot Scott to death.   Police Chief Eddie Driggers said Tuesday that Slager had been arrested. Mayor Keith Summey added during a news conference that as a result of the video and Slager’s “bad decision,” the officer would be charged with murder.   Summey said Slager’s actions were not representative of the entire police force.   “When you’re wrong, you’re wrong,” Summey said. “When you make a bad decision, don’t care if you’re behind the shield or a citizen on the street, you have to live with that decision.”   The footage, filmed by an anonymous bystander, shows the end of the confrontation between the two on Saturday after Scott, who had a warrant out for his arrest, ran from a traffic stop. It was the first piece of evidence that could contradict a statement that Slager released to the public through his attorney.   SLED spokesman Thom Berry said Tuesday that he could not confirm whether the agency has the video.   “All I can say is that our investigation is continuing,” Berry said, “and it would be inappropriate for us to discuss any specifics at this time.”   Attorney David Aylor, who released a statement on Slager’s behalf earlier this week, said Tuesday that he wasn’t representing the officer anymore.   “I’m no longer involved in form or fashion,” Aylor said.   Slager has said through Aylor that Scott had wrested his Taser from him during a struggle. The officer felt threatened when he fired, his attorney said.   Deputy Coroner Brittney Martin was not immediately available Tuesday to confirm how many times Scott was hit.   At the time, Scott was wanted for arrest on a Family Court warrant, Charleston County sheriff’s Maj. Eric Watson said Tuesday.   He had a history of arrests related to contempt of court charges for failing to pay child support. The only accusation of violence against Scott during his lifetime came through a 1987 assault and battery charge, but the disposition of that charge was not immediately known.   Public sentiment  The footage comes amid a discussion about race and policing in the U.S.   Scott was black. Slager is white.   The nationwide conversation was sparked by the fatal shooting in August of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Brown, an 18-year-old black man, was unarmed at the time, but witnesses said he got into a struggle with Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, and was shot during the scuffle.   Though a grand jury did not find any reason to indict Wilson, the shooting ignited protests, some of which turned violent. A “black lives matter” movement inspired talk about whether police nationwide too quickly resort to deadly force against black men.   During that wave of public sentiment that prompted rallies in the Charleston area, South Carolina Trooper Sean Groubert, who is white, was arrested for shooting Levar Jones, a black man who had reached into his pickup for his driver’s license during a September traffic stop in Columbia. Groubert faces a charge of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, and the state settled a lawsuit by Jones for $300,000.

The video recorded by Feidin Santana shocked the nation when it was released this week. The footage resulted in Officer Michael Slager, 33, being arrested and charged with murder Tuesday for the shooting death of Walter Scott, 50, after a traffic stop in North Charleston Saturday.  "I won't deny that I knew the magnitude of this, and I even thought about erasing the video," Santana said in an interview on MSNBC's "All In With Chris Hayes" Wednesday.  "I felt that my life, with this information, might be in danger. I thought about erasing the video and just getting out of the community, you know Charleston, and living some place else," the 23-year-old said. "I knew the cop didn't do the right thing."

While the good people of City of North Charleston, South Carolina reflected on the meaning of the day before Easter. Walter Scott, a 50 year old Veteran of the Coast Guard and Father of four was running for his life because of a broken tail light and a warrant for child support backpay.  33 year old Officer Michael T. Slager immediately claimed he feared for his life in a 911 call because Scott had taken the stun gun from him in a scuffle. The video clearly tells a completely different story, as Officer Slager plants the stun gun next to Scott’s face down and limp handcuffed body in full view of another officer. Who needs to be investigated as well.  The law worked, because the surveillance state works both ways. And after reviewing the video, unlike the outcome of the blatant death of Eric Garner, the good people of North Charlotte knew what happened was wrong. The scales of Law and order were honored rather than ignored. And it didn’t take a multi million dollar routing of liberty like the Department Of Justice's Unconstitutional COPS program to make it happen. Its real simple,The system works when its not being violated.  Help us spread the word about the liberty movement, we're reaching millions help us reach millions more. we all want liberty.

We have thousands of police officers entrusted with other people’s lives every day, but when the worst case scenario hits of them abusing that power, we do not have a system in place that ensures we will know what happened. In fact, when the worst case scenario hits of an officer abusing their power, that’s precisely when it’s most likely we will have to take that officers word for what happened unless one of us just happens to be there recording.tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-08T17:21:48.000Zduration=PT4M20SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=37438likes=493dislikes=16favourite=0comments=133topicIds=null0  Video: id=2KZ5BTNSHtQtitle=Walter Scott's Killing Is Every Black Nightmaredescription=Joe Madison, The Joe Madison Show on SiriusXM ch. 126 joins Thom Hartmann.

Charlamagne touched on the problems with racism in today's modern world and also sided with actor Isaiah Washington's comments on adapting to people who are a different race. The radio show hosts says he understands the actor's views and in some scenarios he has even gone out of his way to make older women of other races feels comfortable.  When it comes to breaking the ice with people from different worlds, Charlamagne says that many people try to break the ice with him by relating to Hip Hop culture.

Scott Jr. Police Shooting Hoax-- FAKE ADDRESS + IDENTITYdescription=This is weird.  After becoming curious about the validity of this supposed "shooting" of Walter L. Scott Jr. from Charleston South Carolina -- I did a search on who Walter Scott was.  After doing multiple searches, I found the radaris and white pages information associated with the only 50yr old Walter L. Scott Jr. who turned up.  Up comes this address:  214 Dogwood Trail Harleyville, SC 29448-3937   If you search that address, the top search return is a known fake identity address !  Complete with fake social security number and fake fraudulent credit card #'s  listed on a website???!!!!!  Supposedly generated by the website to "protect" from identity theft?  Supposedly randomly generated, however each time you search the address the SAME "randomly" generated information comes up.  So.. is it randomly generated only  once??  Like I said, this is weird.  Is Walter L. Scott Jr. from Harleyville, or is that just a fake address he used (just outside of Charleston SC?)  Wow, really?

This isn’t Ferguson or Michael Brown or Eric Garner or even Tamir Rice or even Akai Gurley. Those cases involved at least the initial argument that a suspect/perp did something that might have warranted an officer’s activities. Michael Brown menaced Officer Darren Wilson. Eric Garner resisted arrest and died from the rigors of the arrest process and not being shot or beaten. This case is different. Walter Scott was executed by an officer who never apparently thought of giving chase. No argument could be made that this man posed a hreat as he merely ran away and never even looked back, nothing furtive or threatening in the least.  We don’t need no stinkin’ grand jury. This North Charleston police officer, now charged with murder, decided he wasn’t going to give chase to a 50 year-old, out of shape traffic and child support miscreant. No, siree! Give chase?! Are you kidding? This cop violated every known rule of police pursuit known to mankind without exception. “When you’re wrong, you’re wrong,” North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey said, announcing the arrest. “When you make a bad decision, I don’t care if you’re behind the shield or a citizen on the street, you have to live with that decision.” It will be a tutorial in police academies (I hope) for generations to come.  http://www.podjockey.com/lionelmedia/2015/04/08/lionel-podcast-the-video-execution-of-walter-scott/tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-08T23:19:47.000Zduration=PT9M42SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=5584likes=101dislikes=6favourite=0comments=86topicIds=null0  Video: id=-PYoJecwyhYtitle=Savage South Carolina Cop Arrested For Murder;Shoots Walter L.Scott Multiple Times In The Backdescription=The officer, Michael T. Slager, 33, said he had feared for his life because the man had taken his stun gun in a scuffle after a traffic stop on Saturday. A video, however, shows the officer firing eight times as the man, Walter L. Scott, 50, fled. The North Charleston mayor announced the state charges at a news conference Tuesday evening.  The shooting came on the heels of high-profile instances of police officers’ using lethal force in New York, Cleveland, Ferguson, Mo., and elsewhere. The deaths have set off a national debate over whether the police are too quick to use force, particularly in cases involving black men. A White House task force has recommended a host of changes to the nation’s police policies, and President Obama sent Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to cities around the country to try to improve police relations with minority neighborhoods.

One of Sean Hannity‘s guests tonight got so pissed off in the middle of a heated argument on the Walter Scott shooting that he just up and left entirely.  Leo Terrell, who’s blown up several times on Hannity’s show before, got really angry with Reverend Jesse Lee Peterson after he said people need to “stop overreacting” in cases like the Scott shooting, because of how much people overreacted in the cases of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown.  He shouted, “I am not going to sit here and listen to this hate! I’m not gonna listen to it!”  Hannity tried to calm things down and actually sided with Terrell, but when Terrell spoke again, the second Peterson piped up, Terrell flipped out again and shouted, “You quiet down! I’m done! I’m done!”  And then, he just left.  When Hannity told this to Peterson, the reverend said, “Leo’s a little coward.”  Watch the video below, via Fox News: HEATED Debate. tonight we enter the twilight zone as sean hannity defends walter scott from twisted sorry excuse for a rev jesse lee peterson.. i have a theory on jess lee peterson that i will keep to self. im sure opthers may feel similar after watchingtags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-10T02:36:02.000Zduration=PT8M3SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=42212likes=220dislikes=35favourite=0comments=461topicIds=[/m/01v054]0  Video: id=a6q_t0Azungtitle=Fox’s Napolitano on Walter Scott Shooting: ‘This Is What People Said Ferguson Was’description=As yet another shooting of an apparently unarmed black man by a white police officer threatened to revive the tensions over the shooting in Ferguson, Judge Andrew Napolitano strongly distinguished the two cases on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning.  “This is not Ferguson,” Napolitano said. “In Ferguson, there was a bona fide fight over the officer’s gun and the officer won the fight. This is two disparate cases. This is a victim running away from the police, shot in the back. This is what some people said Ferguson was, but it turned out it wasn’t.”  Walter Scott was shot five times in the back Saturday morning after fleeing from Officer Michael Slager during a scuffle following a traffic stop. Though Slager later said Scott had attempted to take his stun gun and that he feared for his life, video showed Scott running away from the officer, who was then apparently seen planting the taser next to Scott’s body.  Slager was charged with murder yesterday. Napolitano said it was unheard of to charge an officer that quickly, and to deny him bail.tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-08T17:07:16.000Zduration=PT5M44SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=1435likes=1dislikes=2favourite=0comments=5topicIds=[/m/05g7p6]1  Video: id=vCze-OqnEjAtitle=Cops Planting Evidence Standard Operating Procedure?description=Cenk Uygur (http://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur) host of The Young Turks discusses the comments from a Fox Legal Analyst that said it used to be standard operating procedure for police to plant evidence on a suspect to guarantee a conviction.   "The shooting of Walter Scott by Officer Michael Slager went viral after a video that suggests Slager was attempting to plant evidence at the time of the shooting. Fox & Friends weighed in, brining on legal analyst Arthur Aidala who told everyone that it used to be standard operating procedure for police to leave evidence around a killed suspect so that the officers could avoid an investigation. Brian Kilmeade was quick to add that in the age of smartphones it was unlikely that this was still the case."  Do you think that planting evidence is standard operation procedure for police?

An incredibly shocking video was recorded by a witness, showing a struggle between the two men - ultimately ending with Officer Slager firing eight shots into Walter Scott's back.  What has been the reaction to this situation? What facts do we know?  Is this another Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown situation?

Video: id=z1gFBN-Ertstitle=Walter Scott Police Shooting 'Tore My Heart to Pieces,' Victim's Mother Saysdescription=Walter Scott Police Shooting 'Tore My Heart to Pieces,' Victim's Mother Says  The relatives of an unarmed South Carolina man who was shot in the back and killed by a police officer said they are devastated by the tragedy – and hope that justice and healing can emerge.  North Charleston officer Michael Slager was charged in the Saturday morning shooting death of Walter “Lamar” Scott, 50, which was captured on video by an unidentified witness. A magistrate denied Slager bond at a hearing Tuesday evening and he was being held at the Charleston County Detention Center.  Judy Scott, the victim’s mother, said her son was a caring person, someone who still called her “Mommy” in adulthood and was raised in the church.  “When I looked at that tape, that was the most horrible thing I’ve ever seen. I am very, very upset concerning it. I almost couldn’t look at it. To see my son running, defenselessly being shot, it just tore my heart to pieces,” she said on "Good Morning America" today.  Judy Scott said her faith has sustained her during her time of mourning.  “I feel sad for the officer who did the shooting, because he’s gonna have to give account for that. And I pray that he would repent to the Lord for what has happened, and we cannot move and act so quickly, we have to think before we take action and remember that we all have … that’s my son. And I’ve lost a son that will never come back. We have his memories, but he will never come back. And I pray that this never happens to anybody else,” she said.  The victim’s brother Anthony Scott said the murder charge was a positive development, but ultimately comes with mixed emotions.  “It is unusual right now, but I feel like we have a little bit more of the process to do. A charge is not being convicted,” Anthony Scott said. “Once a conviction is put in place, I’ll feel a whole lot better.”  Scott had four children. The family says it will file a civil suit.tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-08T14:51:25.000Zduration=PT6M12SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=5393likes=22dislikes=10favourite=0comments=47topicIds=null0

Scott was shot in the back eight times while fleeing a police officer after a traffic stop went horribly wrong.  We have thousands of police officers entrusted with other people’s lives every day, but when the worst case scenario hits of them abusing that power, we do not have a system in place that ensures we will know what happened. In fact, when the worst case scenario hits of an officer abusing their power, that’s precisely when it’s most likely we will have to take that officers word for what happened unless one of us just happens to be there recording.tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-08T17:21:48.000Zduration=PT4M20SisLiscensed=truedefination=hdviews=37438likes=493dislikes=16favourite=0comments=133topicIds=null0

Video: id=QBRY6VsNsL8title=The Brilliant Idiots: Charlamagne & Andrew Schulz Talk Walter Scott Case & Racismdescription=http://www.vladtv.com - On their most recent Brilliant Idiots podcast, Charlamagne Tha God and Andrew Schulz talk about racism, injustices in the police system and the killing of Walter Scott.  Charlamagne touched on the problems with racism in today's modern world and also sided with actor Isaiah Washington's comments on adapting to people who are a different race. The radio show hosts says he understands the actor's views and in some scenarios he has even gone out of his way to make older women of other races feels comfortable.  When it comes to breaking the ice with people from different worlds, Charlamagne says that many people try to break the ice with him by relating to Hip Hop culture. Some of his stories included older white people singing Hip Hop tunes like ILoveMakonnen's "Tuesday" or conversations about the hit TV show, Empire.  The hosts also talked about Walter Scott and the different practices done in police departments all over the country.

Video: id=Gm7NYbHIzTwtitle=The Video Execution of Walter Scottdescription=Forget anything and everything you’ve heard or thought about police shootings. This isn’t Ferguson or Michael Brown or Eric Garner or even Tamir Rice or even Akai Gurley. Those cases involved at least the initial argument that a suspect/perp did something that might have warranted an officer’s activities. Michael Brown menaced Officer Darren Wilson. Eric Garner resisted arrest and died from the rigors of the arrest process and not being shot or beaten. This case is different. Walter Scott was executed by an officer who never apparently thought of giving chase. No argument could be made that this man posed a hreat as he merely ran away and never even looked back, nothing furtive or threatening in the least.  We don’t need no stinkin’ grand jury. This North Charleston police officer, now charged with murder, decided he wasn’t going to give chase to a 50 year-old, out of shape traffic and child support miscreant. No, siree! Give chase?! Are you kidding? This cop violated every known rule of police pursuit known to mankind without exception. “When you’re wrong, you’re wrong,” North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey said, announcing the arrest. “When you make a bad decision, I don’t care if you’re behind the shield or a citizen on the street, you have to live with that decision.” It will be a tutorial in police academies (I hope) for generations to come.  http://www.podjockey.com/lionelmedia/2015/04/08/lionel-podcast-the-video-execution-of-walter-scott/tags=nullpublishedAt=2015-04-08T23:19:47.000Zduration=PT9M42SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=5584likes=101dislikes=6favourite=0comments=86topicIds=null0
Video: id=-PYoJecwyhYtitle=Savage South Carolina Cop Arrested For Murder;Shoots Walter L.Scott Multiple Times In The Backdescription=The officer, Michael T. Slager, 33, said he had feared for his life because the man had taken his stun gun in a scuffle after a traffic stop on Saturday. A video, however, shows the officer firing eight times as the man, Walter L. Scott, 50, fled. The North Charleston mayor announced the state charges at a news conference Tuesday evening.  The shooting came on the heels of high-profile instances of police officers’ using lethal force in New York, Cleveland, Ferguson, Mo., and elsewhere. The deaths have set off a national debate over whether the police are too quick to use force, particularly in cases involving black men. A White House task force has recommended a host of changes to the nation’s police policies, and President Obama sent Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to cities around the country to try to improve police relations with minority neighborhoods.

He shouted, “I am not going to sit here and listen to this hate!
