Video: id=Nh6H0GiTgcstitle=India launches first unmanned moon missiondescription=http://www.instablogs.com/ India launches first unmanned moon mission The successful launch of the unmanned moon mission is a giant leap for India. With this latest achievement India stands tall an proud space fraternity dominated by the likes of US, Russia and China. Chandrayaan I demonstrates India's determination to be a big player in the race to find the gas Helium-3, a replacement for fossil fuels. One of the mission's objectives is to understand the mineralogy of the moon in greater detail and work out how much Helium-3 is hidden beneath the craters.Helium-3 is a hundred times more precious than gold and is touted as the future fuel of nuclear plants and vehicles. We hope that by carrying out this mission we will have a greater claim on the fuel of the future when man begins to colonise the satellite. This is just the beginning of India's space ambitions. We hope to put the first Indian into space by 2014 and launch a manned lunar mission by 2020 â four years ahead of rival China. Cheers to ISRO that has done the country proud.tags=nullpublishedAt=2008-10-22T14:58:14.000Zduration=PT1M27SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=2689likes=9dislikes=0favourite=0comments=2topicIds=[/m/04wv_]0

Chandrayaan I (Sanskrit: चंद्रयान-1, lit: Lunar Craft), is an unmanned lunar exploration mission by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The mission includes a lunar orbiter as well as an impactor. The spacecraft will be launched by a modified version of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.. . The remote sensing satellite will weigh 1304 kg (590 kg initial orbit mass and 504 kg dry mass) and carry high resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, soft and hard X-ray frequencies. Over a two-year period, it is intended to survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and 3-dimensional topography. The polar regions are of special interest, as they might contain water ice.. . The mission includes five ISRO payloads. Six other payloads from NASA, ESA, and the Bulgarian Aerospace Agency are getting free ride thanks to the Indian generosity.. . Mission Objectives:. . 1) To launch and orbit a spacecraft in lunar polar orbit and conduct scientific studies.. 2) To carry out high resolution mapping of topographic features in 3D, distribution of various minerals and elemental chemical species including radioactive nuclides covering the entire lunar surface using a set of remote sensing payloads. The new set of data would help in unraveling mysteries about the origin and evolution of solar system in general and that of the moon in particular or on its composition and mineralogy.. 3) Realize the mission goal of harnessing the science payloads, lunar craft and the launch vehicle with suitable ground support system including DSN station, integration and testing, launching and achieving lunar orbit of ~100 km, in-orbit operation of experiments, communication/telecommand, telemetry data reception, quick look data and archival for scientific utilization by identified group of scientists.tags=nullpublishedAt=2008-10-17T20:02:57.000Zduration=PT4M54SisLiscensed=truedefination=sdviews=37173likes=53dislikes=6favourite=0comments=48topicIds=[/m/03_835, /m/04wv_]0

Video: id=ehyHRjR5844title=India Moon Mission Chandrayaan - 1 ISRO official Documentary 1/3description=Chandrayaan-1 (Sanskrit: चंद्रयान-१, lit: moon-traveller, or moon vehicle  pronunciation (help·info)) was India's first unmanned lunar probe. It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation in October 2008, and operated until August 2009. The mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor. India launched the spacecraft by a modified version of the PSLV, PSLV C11 on 22 October 2008 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Nellore District, Andhra Pradesh, about 80 km north of Chennai, at 06:22 IST (00:52 UTC). The mission was a major boost to India's space program, as India researched and developed its own technology in order to explore the Moon. The vehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.. . On 14 November 2008, the Moon Impact Probe separated from the Chandrayaan orbiter at 20:06 and struck the south pole in a controlled manner, making India the fourth country to place its flag on the Moon. The probe impacted near Shackleton Crater at 20:31 ejecting underground soil that could be analysed for the presence of lunar water ice.. The estimated cost for the project was Rs. 386 crore (US$ 90 million).. . The remote sensing lunar satellite had a mass of 1,380 kilograms (3,042 lb) at launch and 675 kilograms (1,488 lb) in lunar orbit. It carried high resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, and soft and hard X-ray frequencies. Over a two-year period, it was intended to survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and three-dimensional topography. The polar regions are of special interest as they might contain ice.. . The lunar mission carries five ISRO payloads and six payloads from other space agencies including NASA, ESA, and the Bulgarian Aerospace Agency, which were carried free of cost.. . After suffering from several technical issues including failure of the star sensors and poor thermal shielding, Chandrayaan stopped sending radio signals at 1:30 AM IST on 29 August 2009 shortly after which, the ISRO officially declared the mission over. Chandrayaan operated for 312 days as opposed to the intended two years but the mission achieved 95 percent of its planned objectives. Among its many achievements was the discovery of the widespread presence of water molecules in lunar soiltags=nullpublishedAt=2010-05-09T04:42:59.000Zduration=PT10M1SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=18530likes=42dislikes=1favourite=0comments=15topicIds=[/m/04wv_, /m/03_835, /m/03zwkz]0

It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation in October 2008, and operated until August 2009. The mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor. India launched the spacecraft by a modified version of the PSLV, PSLV C11 on 22 October 2008 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Nellore District, Andhra Pradesh, about 80 km north of Chennai, at 06:22 IST (00:52 UTC). The mission was a major boost to India's space program, as India researched and developed its own technology in order to explore the Moon. The vehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.. . On 14 November 2008, the Moon Impact Probe separated from the Chandrayaan orbiter at 20:06 and struck the south pole in a controlled manner, making India the fourth country to place its flag on the Moon. The probe impacted near Shackleton Crater at 20:31 ejecting underground soil that could be analysed for the presence of lunar water ice.. The estimated cost for the project was Rs. 386 crore (US$ 90 million).. . The remote sensing lunar satellite had a mass of 1,380 kilograms (3,042 lb) at launch and 675 kilograms (1,488 lb) in lunar orbit. It carried high resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, and soft and hard X-ray frequencies. Over a two-year period, it was intended to survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and three-dimensional topography. The polar regions are of special interest as they might contain ice.. . The lunar mission carries five ISRO payloads and six payloads from other space agencies including NASA, ESA, and the Bulgarian Aerospace Agency, which were carried free of cost.. . After suffering from several technical issues including failure of the star sensors and poor thermal shielding, Chandrayaan stopped sending radio signals at 1:30 AM IST on 29 August 2009 shortly after which, the ISRO officially declared the mission over. Chandrayaan operated for 312 days as opposed to the intended two years but the mission achieved 95 percent of its planned objectives.

Video: id=y6aRFY4zaVAtitle=India's Moon Missiondescription=Now its India turn to join the elite club.. . *The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) announced that the first lunar probe, Chandrayaan-1, from India landed successfully on the moon on Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's birthday. The Indian flag was painted on the sides of Moon Impact Probe (MIP), one of the 11 payloads of Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, that successfully hit the lunar surface on November 14th, at 20:31 hrs (8:31 pm) IST. This is the first Indian built object to reach the surface of the moon. The point of MIP's impact was near the Moon's South Polar Region. It may be recalled that the modern Indian space program was initiated in 1962 when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister of India. The two-year mission is aimed to map not only the surface of the moon, but what lies beneath. The unmanned moon mission was launched Oct. 22 from the Sriharikota space center in southern India. The box-shaped probe carried a video imaging system, a radar altimeter and a mass spectrometer. ISRO spokesman B.R. Guruprasad said that the probe from the orbiting mother spacecraft took pictures and gathered other data India needs for a future moon landing as it plummeted to a crash-landing at the moon's south pole.. . ニュースアニメ「インド初の無人月探査機、月面着陸に成功」. インド初の無人月探査機「チャンドラヤーン１号」が、月面着陸に成功したと、インド宇宙研究機関（ISRO）が発表した。「チャンドラヤーン」はサンスクリット語で「月の乗り物」の意。１０月２２日にインド南部スリハリコタの宇宙センターから打ち上げられ、ネルー初代インド首相の誕生日でもある１１月１４日に月面に着陸した。元首相は１９６２年に近代インドの宇宙計画を打ち出しており、ISROは歴史的な日になったと述べている。月探査を成功させた国は、現在まで旧ソ連、米、日、欧（ESA）、中となるが、今回の打ち上げはこれに次ぐものとなる。今後２年間をかけ、月面の様子を詳しく調べるほか、水や氷の存在についても調査する。今回の打ち上げにかかった費用は３８億６千万ルピー。tags=nullpublishedAt=2008-11-21T11:01:28.000Zduration=PT8SisLiscensed=falsedefination=sdviews=9415likes=27dislikes=6favourite=0comments=14topicIds=[/m/04wv_, /m/03_835]0
